# ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The principles in The World After Capital are the basis for the Eutopia Foundation, which was started by myself and my wife Susan “Gigi” Danziger. Eutopia’s mission is to spread Humanism through building replicable models for making the world a better place. Without Gigi’s partnership, support and critical feedback, I would never have been able to write this book.

I am grateful to all the people who have helped me along the way: my parents, who wholeheartedly supported my interest in computers at a time when it was quite unusual and expensive to do so; my wife Gigi Danziger and our children, Michael, Katie and Peter, who make me a better person; my many teachers, including Erik Brynjolfsson and Bengt Holmström, from whom I learned so much; my partners at Union Square Ventures, starting with Fred Wilson and Brad Burnham, who invited me to join the firm they had started; the many entrepreneurs I have had the opportunity to work with; the philosophers and scientists, such as David Deutsch and Chiara Marletto, who have demonstrated the power of human knowledge; the friends who have been there through good and bad times; and the many people who have taken the time to comment on the book and on my blog, who have invited me to speak, who have contributed in ways small and large, with special mentions for Ed Cooke for some of the earliest feedback, Seth Schulman for work on an early draft, Basil Vetas for capable research assistance, Nick Humphrey for goldilocks editing, Paul Reeves for intellectual pushback, Mona Alsubaei for perceptive feedback and crucial contributions to finishing the first edition of the book, Lucy Gillespie for assisting with the audio edition book events, and last but not least Max Roser and the team at the *Our World in Data* project for their extensive data collection and visualization.

Second edition: I am hugely grateful to my friend Dominik Wichmann for encouraging me to update The World After Capital in a second edition and connecting me with Piper Verlag. A shout out to Shane Mac for a suggestion on language. And finally a huge thanks to Andrei Teusianu and the team at Piper for all their support.
