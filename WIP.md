# Work in Progress

This book is a work in progress. I am currently in the midst of working through the entire book with an editor. The first half, up to and including Part Three, have been updated as a result. I will be tackling the second half in the coming weeks (as a result you may find some inconsistencies). References are currently broken and will be fixed in a later pass.

The process of writing in this way is an example of what I call the &ldquo;Knowledge Loop&rdquo; in the book. The Knowledge Loop consists of learning, creating and sharing. My writing is based on what I have learned. By sharing early, others can learn from my ideas and I, in turn, can learn from their feedback.

I know how powerful this approach is from my experience with <a href="http://continuations.com">blogging</a> for over a decade. I have learned a great deal from reader comments. The same has been true here. You can see some of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q--KXVvxPM9NNUdJwi_szRhuA8oeg1ciaggFC7qKBuc/edit?usp=sharing">amazing initial feedback</a>. Thanks to everyone who has taken the time. If you want to send me a comment please email me at <a href="mailto:albert@worldaftercapital.org">albert@worldaftercapital.org</a>. 

I am using <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/book/worldaftercapital/worldaftercapital/details">gitbook</a> to write *The World After Capital* and you can track the changes I am making on <a href="https://github.com/WorldAfterCapital/WorldAfterCapital">github</a>. If you are knowledgable in using github you can also make a <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">pull request</a> as a way of contributing. I retain final &ldquo;commit rights&rdquo; for changes and as such take responsibility for any and all errors.

There is also a separate <a href="http://worldaftercapital.org/faq/">FAQ</a> which I will be updating periodically. If you prefer reading on paper or on an eReader, you can <a href="https://worldaftercapital.gitbook.io/worldaftercapital/">download a copy in PDF</a>.
