# Work in Progress

This book has long been a work in progress. I am happy to report that it is approaching completion. The body of the text is in final form, subject to copy editing. The references are also in good shape. The Appendix has been revised substantially.  ok

The process of writing iteratively in public is an example of what I call the &ldquo;Knowledge Loop&rdquo; in the book. The Knowledge Loop consists of learning, creating and sharing. My writing is based on what I have learned. By sharing early, others can learn from my ideas and I, in turn, can learn from their feedback.

I know how powerful this approach is from my experience with <a href="http://continuations.com">blogging</a> for over a decade. I have learned a great deal from reader comments. The same has been true here. You can see some of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q--KXVvxPM9NNUdJwi_szRhuA8oeg1ciaggFC7qKBuc/edit?usp=sharing">amazing initial feedback</a>. Thanks to everyone who has taken the time. If you want to send me a comment please email me at <a href="mailto:albert@worldaftercapital.org">albert@worldaftercapital.org</a>. 

I am using <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/book/worldaftercapital/worldaftercapital/details">gitbook</a> to write *The World After Capital* and you can track the changes I am making on <a href="https://github.com/WorldAfterCapital/WorldAfterCapital">github</a>. If you are knowledgable in using github you can also make a <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">pull request</a> as a way of contributing. I retain final &ldquo;commit rights&rdquo; for changes and as such take responsibility for any and all errors.

There is also a separate <a href="http://worldaftercapital.org/faq/">FAQ</a> which I will be updating periodically. If you prefer reading on paper or on an eReader, you can <a href="https://worldaftercapital.gitbook.io/worldaftercapital/">download a copy in PDF</a>.
