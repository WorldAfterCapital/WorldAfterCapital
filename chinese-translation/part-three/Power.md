# The Power of Knowledge
# 知识的力量

Have you watched television recently? Stored food in a refrigerator? Accessed the Internet? Played games on your smartphone? Driven a car? These are all things that billions of people around the world do every day. And while they are produced by different companies using a wide range of technologies, none of them would be possible without the existence of knowledge.

你最近看了电视吗？在冰箱里储存了食物？上过互联网吗？在你的智能手机上玩游戏？驾驶汽车？这些都是全世界数十亿人每天都在做的事情。虽然它们是由不同的公司使用广泛的技术生产的，但如果没有知识的存在，这些都是不可能的。

Knowledge, as I have earlier defined it, is the information that humanity has recorded in a medium and improved over time. As a reminder, there are two crucial parts to this definition. The first is “recorded in a medium,” which allows information to be shared across time and space. The second is “improved over time,” which separates knowledge from information. Improvement is the result of the operation of the critical process, which allows for existing knowledge to be criticized and alternatives to be proposed. Through this process knowledge becomes better at helping us humans meet our needs.

正如我前面所定义的那样，知识是人类用一种媒介记录下来并随着时间的推移而改进的信息。作为提醒，这个定义有两个关键部分。第一部分是『记录在媒介中』，这使得信息可以跨越时间和空间共享。第二个部分是『随着时间的推移而改进』，它将知识与信息分开。改进是关键过程运作的结果，它允许对现有知识进行批评并提出替代方案。通过这个过程，知识在帮助我们人类满足需求方面变得更好。

I began this section with examples of everyday technologies that would not exist without knowledge. An even stronger illustration of the power of knowledge is that without it, many of us would not even be here today. As we saw in our discussion of population, Malthus was right about population growth but wrong about its consequences because he did not foresee the development of technological progress powered by improved knowledge. 

我在本节开始时举了一些日常技术的例子，如果没有知识就不会存在。对知识力量的一个更有力的说明是，没有知识，我们中的许多人甚至不会有今天。正如我们在讨论人口问题时看到的那样，马尔萨斯对人口增长的看法是正确的，但对其后果的看法是错误的，因为他没有预见到由改进的知识推动的技术进步的发展。

Let’s look at a specific example of how this process unfolded. Humans breathe air, but for a long time we did not know what it consisted of. Oxygen and nitrogen, the two primary components of air, were not identified as elements until the late eighteenth century. 

让我们看一下这个过程是如何展开的一个具体例子。人类呼吸空气，但在很长一段时间里，我们不知道空气是由什么组成的。氧气和氮气，空气的两个主要成分，直到十八世纪末才被确定为元素。

Separately, although manure had been used in agricultural practice for millennia, it was not properly studied until the early nineteenth century. By the late 19th century, scientists had finally discovered the microbes that convert nitrogen into a form that plants can use. That led to the understanding that ammonia, which consists of nitrogen and hydrogen, is a powerful fertilizer. Scientific progress eventually resulted in the Haber process for nitrogen fixation which allows for the mass production of fertilizer. Invented in the early twentieth century, it became crucial to raising agricultural yields globally, thus averting the dire consequences Malthus had envisaged. Today, about half of the nitrogen in humans bodies has been touched by the Haber process on its way into the plants and animals that we eat.

另外，尽管粪便在农业实践中已经使用了几千年，但直到十九世纪初才对它进行了适当的研究。到十九世纪末，科学家们终于发现了将氮转化为植物可以使用的形式的微生物。这使人们认识到，由氮和氢组成的氨是一种强大的肥料。科学的进步最终导致了哈伯固氮过程的出现，这使得肥料的大规模生产成为可能。二十世纪初发明的这一工艺对提高全球农业产量至关重要，从而避免了马尔萨斯设想的可怕后果。今天，人类体内约有一半的氮在进入我们所吃的植物和动物的过程中被哈伯过程所触及。

My simplified history of the discovery of nitrogen fixation doesn’t capture the many false starts along the way. It seems strange to us now, but at one point a leading theory as to why some materials burn was that they all contain a substance called ‘phlogiston,’ which was thought to be released during combustion or ‘dephlogistication.’ Without the improvement of knowledge over time, we might have remained stuck on that theory, failing to find oxygen and nitrogen and thus to increase agricultural yields, and thereby potentially exposing humanity to a Malthusian crisis. 

我对发现固氮作用的简化历史并没有捕捉到沿途的许多错误开始。在我们现在看来很奇怪，但在某一时期，关于一些材料燃烧的主要理论是它们都含有一种叫做 *phlogiston* 的物质（燃素），人们认为它是在燃烧或 *dephlogistication*（去燃素）过程中释放的。如果没有随着时间推移知识的改进，我们可能一直停留在这个理论上，无法找到氧气和氮气，从而无法提高农业产量，从而有可能使人类面临马尔萨斯危机。

This is just one example of a knowledge breakthrough that allowed humanity to overcome a seemingly insurmountable barrier to progress. When thinking about the power of knowledge, we must remember that both our individual lifetimes and the history of modern science to-date are trivially short in the timescale of humanity, which in turn is minuscule compared to that of the universe. When considering longer timeframes, we should regard all speculative technological advances that don’t contravene the laws of physics as possible and eventually achievable. This line of thinking about the power of knowledge is inspired by a theoretical foundation for science recently developed by the physicists David Deutsch and Chiara Marletto called constructor theory (“Constructor Theory,” 2020). 

这只是知识突破的一个例子，它使人类克服了一个看似不可逾越的进步障碍。在思考知识的力量时，我们必须记住，无论是我们个人的一生还是迄今为止的现代科学史，在人类的时间尺度上都是微不足道的，而人类的时间尺度与宇宙的时间尺度相比又是微不足道的。在考虑更长的时间范围时，我们应该把所有不违反物理定律的推测性技术进步视为可能的，并最终可以实现。这种关于知识力量的思路受到物理学家大卫·多伊奇和基娅拉·马莱托最近提出的科学理论基础的启发，该理论被称为构造者理论（《构造者理论》，2020）。

Consider for a moment what knowledge might allow us to do in the more or less distant future. We might rid ourselves of our dependence on fossil fuels, cure any disease, and travel to other planets in our solar system (organizations like SpaceX and NASA are already working toward this goal) (NASA, 2018). Eventually, we might even travel to the stars. You might think interstellar travel is impossible, but it isn’t. Extremely difficult? Yes. Requiring technology that doesn’t exist yet? Yes. But impossible? No. It is definitely not imminent, but we can count on it to becoming possible with the further accretion of knowledge. 

请考虑一下，在或多或少遥远的未来，知识可能会让我们做什么。我们可能会摆脱对化石燃料的依赖，治愈任何疾病，并前往太阳系的其他星球（像 SpaceX 和 NASA 这样的组织已经在为这个目标而努力）（NASA，2018）。最终，我们甚至可能前往恒星。你可能认为星际旅行是不可能的，但它并不是。极其困难？是的。需要尚不存在的技术？是的。但不可能？它绝对不是迫在眉睫的，但我们可以指望随着知识的进一步积累，它将成为可能。

We are the only species on Earth that has created knowledge—not just science, but also art. Art allows us to express our hopes and fears, and culture has helped to motivate the large-scale coordination and mobilization of human effort. We might think of the technical component of knowledge as underpinning the ‘how’ of our lives, and the artistic component the ‘why’. If you’ve ever doubted the power of art, just think of the many times throughout history when dictators and authoritarian regimes have banned or destroyed works of art.

我们是地球上唯一创造了知识的物种 —— 不仅仅是科学，还有艺术。艺术使我们能够表达我们的希望和恐惧，而文化则有助于激励人类的大规模协调和动员。我们可以认为，知识的技术部分支撑着我们生活的『如何』，而艺术部分则是『为什么』。如果你曾经怀疑过艺术的力量，只要想想历史上独裁者和独裁政权多次禁止或摧毁艺术作品的情况就知道了。

## The Knowledge Loop 
## 知识循环 

Knowledge has already made possible something extraordinary: by means of the innovations of the Industrial Age we can, in principle, meet everyone’s needs. But we must generate additional knowledge to solve the problems we have introduced along the way, such as the climate crisis. New knowledge does not spring forth fully formed out of a vacuum. Instead it emerges through what I call the ‘knowledge loop’, in which someone learns something and creates something new, which is then shared and in turn serves as the basis for more learning.

知识已经使一些非凡的事情成为可能：通过工业时代的创新，我们原则上可以满足每个人的需求。但我们必须产生更多的知识，以解决我们一路走来所带来的问题，如气候危机。新的知识不会从真空中完全形成。相反，它是通过我所说的『知识循环』出现的，在这个循环中，有人学习了一些东西并创造了一些新的东西，然后这些东西被分享，反过来成为更多学习的基础。

![The Knowledge Loop](../assets/knowledge-loop.png)

The knowledge loop has been around since humans first developed written language, some five thousand years ago. Before that, humans were able to use spoken language, but that limits learning and sharing in terms of both time and space. Since the invention of written language, breakthroughs have accelerated and access to the knowledge loop has broadened. Those include moveable type (around one thousand years ago), the printing press (around five hundred years ago) and more recently the telegraph, radio and television. Now we are in the middle of another fundamental breakthrough: digital technology, which connects all of humanity to the knowledge loop at zero marginal cost, and also allows machines themselves to participate in it.

自从人类在大约五千年前首次开发出书面语言以来，知识循环就一直存在。在此之前，人类能够使用口语，但这在时间和空间上都限制了学习和分享。自从发明书面语言以来，突破性的进展加快了，进入知识圈的途径也扩大了。这些包括可移动的字体（大约一千年前），印刷术（大约五百年前）和最近的电报、广播和电视。现在，我们正处于另一个根本性的突破之中：数字技术，它以零边际成本将全人类连接到知识圈，并允许机器本身参与其中。

It is easy to underestimate the potential of digital technology to further accelerate and broaden access to the knowledge loop. To many people, it seems as if these innovations have so far under-delivered. The technology investor Peter Thiel once famously complained that “We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.” In fact, we have made great progress on flying cars since then, in no small part because digital technologies have already helped accelerate the knowledge loop.

我们很容易低估数字技术在进一步加速和拓宽知识圈方面的潜力。对许多人来说，这些创新似乎到目前为止还没有达到预期效果。技术投资者彼得·蒂尔曾有一句著名的抱怨：『我们想要的是飞行汽车，而我们得到的却是 140 个字符』。事实上，从那时起，我们在飞行汽车方面已经取得了巨大的进展，这在很大程度上是因为数字技术已经帮助加速了知识循环。

## The Promise and Peril of the Digital Knowledge Loop 
## 数字知识圈的前景和危险 

The zero marginal cost and universality of digital technologies are already accelerating learning, creating and sharing, giving rise to a digital knowledge loop. And as can be seen in the example of YouTube, it holds both amazing promise and great peril.

数字技术的零边际成本和普遍性已经加速了学习、创造和分享，产生了一个数字知识循环。从 YouTube 的例子中可以看出，它既拥有惊人的前景，也存在巨大的危险。

YouTube has experienced astounding growth since its launch in 2005. People around the world now upload over 100 hours of video content to the platform every minute. To illustrate just how much content that is, if you were to spend 100 years watching YouTube 24 hours a day, you would be unable to watch all the videos uploaded in a single week. YouTube contains amazing educational content on topics as diverse as gardening and pure mathematics. Many of those videos illustrate the promise of the digital knowledge loop, but the peril is also clear: YouTube also contains videos that peddle conspiracies, spread misinformation and even incite hate. Promoting such videos may, perversely, be in YouTube’s interest, as these capture more attention, which can then be resold to advertisers, thus growing YouTube’s revenues and profits. 

自 2005 年推出以来 ，YouTube 经历了令人震惊的增长。现在，世界各地的人们每分钟向该平台上传 100 多个小时的视频内容。为了说明这有多少内容，如果你花 100 年时间每天 24 小时观看 YouTube，你将无法看完一个星期内上传的所有视频 。YouTube 包含了惊人的教育内容，主题包括园艺和纯数学等。其中许多视频说明了数字知识圈的前景，但危险也很明显 ：YouTube 也包含兜售阴谋、传播错误信息、甚至煽动仇恨的视频。推广这类视频可能反倒符合 YouTube 的利益，因为这些视频能吸引更多的注意力，然后可以转卖给广告商，从而增加 YouTube 的收入和利润。

Both the promise and the peril are made possible by the same characteristics of the platform: all of the videos are available for free to anyone in the world, and they become available globally the second they are published. Anybody can publish a video, and all you need to access them is an Internet connection and a smartphone. As a result, two to three billion people, almost half of the world’s population, has access to YouTube and can participate in the digital knowledge loop. 

前景和危险都是由该平台的相同特点促成的：所有的视频对世界上的任何人都是免费的，而且在发布的一瞬间就可以在全球范围内获得。任何人都可以发布视频，你只需要一个互联网连接和一部智能手机就可以访问它们。因此，20 至 30 亿人，几乎占世界人口的一半，可以访问 YouTube，并可以参与数字知识圈。

These characteristics are found in other systems that similarly show the promise and peril of the digital knowledge loop. Wikipedia, the collectively produced online encyclopedia, is another good example. At its most promising, someone might read an entry and learn the method Pythagoras used to approximate pi, then create an animation that illustrates this method, publishing it on Wikipedia, thus making it easier for other people to learn. Wikipedia entries result from collaboration and an ongoing revision process. You can also examine both the history of the page and the conversations about it, thanks to a piece of software known as a ‘wiki’ that keeps track of the history of edits to a page (“Wiki,” n.d.). When the process works, it raises the quality of entries over time. But when there is a coordinated effort at manipulation, Wikipedia can spread misinformation instantly and globally. 

这些特征在其他系统中也可以找到，这些系统同样显示了数字知识圈的前景和危险性。维基百科，这个集体制作的在线百科全书，是另一个好例子。在它最有希望的时候，有人可能会阅读一个条目并学习毕达哥拉斯用来估算圆周率的方法，然后创建一个动画来说明这个方法，并将其发布在维基百科上，从而使其他人更容易学习。维基百科的条目来自于合作和持续的修订过程。你还可以检查页面的历史和关于它的对话，这要归功于一个被称为 *wiki*（维基）的软件，它记录了对一个页面的编辑历史（"wiki"，n.d.）。当这个过程成功时，它可以随着时间的推移提高条目的质量。但是，当有一个协调的操纵努力时，维基百科可以立即在全球传播错误信息。

Wikipedia illustrates another important aspect of the digital knowledge loop: it allows individuals to participate in extremely small ways. If you wish, you can contribute to Wikipedia by fixing a single typo. If ten thousand people fixed one typo every day, that would be 3.65 million typos a year. If we assume that it takes two minutes to discover and fix a typo, it would take nearly fifty people working full-time for a year (2,500 hours) to fix that many typos. 

维基百科说明了数字知识圈的另一个重要方面：它允许个人以极小的方式参与。如果你愿意，你可以通过修正一个错别字来为维基百科做出贡献。如果每天有一万个人修正一个错别字，那么一年就有 365 万个错别字。如果我们假设发现和修正一个错别字需要两分钟，那么需要近 50 人全职工作一年（2500 小时）才能修正这么多错别字。

The example of a Wikipedia spelling correction shows the power of small contributions that add up within the digital knowledge loop. Their peril can be seen on social networks such as Twitter and Facebook, where the small contributions are likes and retweets or reposts to one’s friends or followers. While these tiny actions can amplify high-quality content, they can also spread mistakes, rumors and propaganda: indeed, research carried out at MIT in 2018 found that fake news stories spread faster and more widely than true ones (Vosoughi et al., 2018) (see “Freedom to Learn”, below). These information cascades can have significant consequences, ranging from jokes going viral to the outcomes of elections being affected. They have even contributed to major outbreaks of violence, as in the well-known case of the brutal persecution of the Rohingya in Myanmar (BBC News, 2018). 

维基百科的拼写更正的例子显示了在数字知识圈中小贡献的力量。在 Twitter 和 Facebook 等社交网络上可以看到它们的危险性，在那里，小贡献是喜欢和转发或转贴给自己的朋友或追随者。虽然这些微小的行动可以放大高质量的内容，但它们也可以传播错误、谣言和宣传：事实上，2018 年在麻省理工学院进行的研究发现，假新闻故事比真新闻传播得更快、更广（Vosoughi et al.，2018）（见下文《学习的自由》）。这些信息级联可以产生重大的后果，从笑话的病毒式传播到选举结果受到影响。它们甚至促成了重大暴力事件的爆发，比如众所周知的缅甸罗兴亚人遭受残酷迫害的案例（BBC News，2018）。

Some platforms make it possible for people to contribute passively to the digital knowledge loop. Waze is a GPS navigation app. It tracks users that seem to be in a car, and the speed at which they are moving. It then passes that information back to its servers, and algorithms figure out where traffic is moving smoothly and where drivers will encounter traffic jams. Waze then proposes alternative routes, taking the traffic into account. If you follow a different route proposed by Waze, you automatically contribute your speed on that detour, a further example of passive contribution. 

一些平台使人们有可能被动地对数字知识圈作出贡献 。Waze 是一个 GPS 导航应用程序。它追踪那些似乎在车里的用户，以及他们的移动速度。然后，它将这些信息传回服务器，通过算法计算出哪里交通顺畅，哪里的司机会遇到交通堵塞。然后 ，Waze 在考虑到交通情况的基础上，提出替代路线。如果你遵循 Waze 提出的不同路线，你会自动贡献出你在这条弯路上的速度，这是一个被动贡献的进一步例子。

To see the peril of passive contribution, consider Google’s autocomplete for search queries, which are derived from what people frequently search for. As a result, they often reflect existing biases, further amplifying them: often, instead of typing out their whole query, users select one of the autocompleted options presented to them. Another example of dangerous passive contribution are suggested ’follows’ on networks such as Twitter. These often present accounts of people similar to the ones someone is already connected with, thus deepening connections among people who think alike while cutting them off from other groups, a phenomenon giving rise to a kind of “Cyber-Balkans” (Van Alstyne & Brynjolfsson, 2005). 

要看到被动贡献的危险性，请考虑 Google 的搜索查询自动完成功能，它来自人们经常搜索的内容。因此，它们往往反映了现有的偏见，并进一步扩大了这些偏见：用户往往不输入他们的整个查询，而是选择呈现给他们的自动完成的选项中的一个。另一个危险的被动贡献的例子是 Twitter 等网络上的建议『关注』。这些人的账户往往与某人已经连接的人相似，从而加深了想法相同的人之间的联系，同时也切断了他们与其他群体的联系，这种现象产生了一种『网络巴尔干』（Van Alstyne & Brynjolfsson, 2005）。

The promise of the digital knowledge loop is broad access to a rapidly improving body of knowledge. The peril is that it will lead to a post-truth society that is constantly in conflict. Both of these possibilities are enabled by the same characteristics of digital technologies. Here once again, we can see that technology by itself does not determine the future.

数字知识圈的承诺是广泛获取快速改进的知识体系。其危险性在于它将导致一个不断冲突的后真相社会。这两种可能性都是由数字技术的相同特征促成的。在这里，我们可以再次看到，技术本身并不能决定未来。

## Technology Is Not Enough 
## 仅仅技术是不够的

To achieve the promise of the digital knowledge loop and sidestep its perils will require human societies to go through a massive transition, on a par with the two previous ones, from the Forager Age to the Agrarian Age and from the Agrarian Age to the Industrial Age. We now need to leave the Industrial Age behind and enter the next one, which I am calling the Knowledge Age. We have based our economies around the job loop, which traps a lot of our attention. We have constructed our laws governing access to information and computation as if they were industrial products. We have adopted a range of beliefs that keep us tied to jobs and consumption, and we are utterly overwhelmed by the new information environment. All of that has to change.

为了实现数字知识圈的承诺并避开其危险，人类社会需要经历一次大规模的转型，与之前的两次转型一样，从觅食时代到农业时代，从农业时代到工业时代。我们现在需要抛弃工业时代，进入下一个时代，我称之为知识时代。我们的经济是围绕着劳务循环的，这吸引了我们大量的注意力。我们构建了管理信息和计算的法律，仿佛它们是工业产品。我们采用了一系列的信念，将我们与工作和消费联系在一起，而我们完全被新的信息环境所淹没了。所有这些都必须要改变。

The transition will be difficult, however, because the Industrial Age is a system with many interlocking parts, and systems are highly resistant to change. As we saw earlier, simply harnessing digital technology to the existing system results in a hugely uneven distribution of power, income and wealth. Even worse, it tilts the digital knowledge loop away from its promise and toward its perils. 

然而，转型将是困难的，因为工业时代是一个有许多相互关联的部分的系统，而系统是非常抗拒变化的。正如我们前面所看到的，简单地将数字技术用于现有系统，会导致权力、收入和财富的巨大不平衡。更糟糕的是，它使数字知识圈偏离了它的承诺，走向了它的危险。

The human species is facing problems that we can only overcome if we use digital technology to alleviate rather than worsen attention scarcity. We must reap the promise and limit the perils of digital technology for the knowledge loop. In order to successfully negotiate the transition into the Knowledge Age, we need to make dramatic changes in both collective regulation and self-regulation. This is what we will explore in Part Four.

人类面临的问题，只有当我们利用数字技术来缓解而不是加剧注意力的匮乏时，我们才能克服。我们必须收获数字技术对知识圈的承诺并限制其危险。为了成功地过渡到知识时代，我们需要在集体监管和自我监管方面做出巨大的改变。这就是我们将在第四部分探讨的内容。
