# Part Three: Attention Is Scarce
# 第三部分：注意力是稀缺的

In saying that attention is scarce, I mean that there is not enough of it available today to meet our needs. That’s what I set out to show in this part of the book. I’ll start by defining attention, before presenting several examples of needs that either are already no longer met due to a lack of attention, such as the need for meaning, or are at risk of not being met in the near future. After that, I will consider how much human attention is currently caught up in Industrial Age activities and how an increasing amount of attention is being trapped through our current uses of digital technology, such as advertising-based social networks. I will also discuss why market-based capitalism cannot be used to allocate attention.

我说注意力是稀缺的，是指今天没有足够的注意力来满足我们的需要。这就是我在本书的这一部分所要说明的。我将从定义注意力开始，然后介绍几个需求的例子，这些需求要么因为缺乏注意力而不再被满足，比如对意义的需求，要么在不久的将来有可能不被满足。之后，我将考虑目前有多少人类的注意力被卷入工业时代的活动中，以及越来越多的注意力是如何通过我们目前对数字技术的使用被困住的，比如基于广告的社交网络。我还将讨论为什么基于市场的资本主义不能被用来分配注意力。
