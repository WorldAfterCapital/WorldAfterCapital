# Attention
# 注意力

Attention is to time as velocity is to speed. If I tell you that I’m driving at a speed of 55 miles per hour, that does not tell you anything about where I’m going, because you don’t know what direction I’m heading in. Velocity is speed plus direction. Similarly, if I tell you that I spent two hours with my family yesterday (time), that does not tell you anything about what our minds were directed at—we could have been having an engaging conversation, or we could have been immersed in our phones. Attention is time plus intentionality.

注意力对于时间来说就像速度对于速度一样。如果我告诉你我正以每小时 55 英里的速度开车，这并不能告诉你我要去哪里，因为你不知道我在往哪个方向走。速度是速度加方向。同样，如果我告诉你我昨天和我的家人呆了两个小时（时间），这并不能告诉你我们的思想在做什么 —— 我们可能在进行有吸引力的谈话，或者我们可能沉浸在手机里。注意力是时间加意向性。

The amount of human attention in the world is finite. We have 24 hours in the day, some of which we need to spend paying attention to eating, sleeping and meeting our other needs. The attention during the remaining hours of most people in the world is taken up by having to earn an income and by consuming goods and services, leaving relatively little time for attention to be freely allocated. A hard limit on available attention also exists for humanity as a whole—as I argued earlier, we are headed for peak population, at which point we will no longer be increasing the total amount of potentially available attention by adding more people. 

人类在这个世界上的注意力是有限的。我们一天只有 24 小时，其中一些时间我们需要用来注意吃饭、睡觉和满足我们的其他需要。世界上大多数人在剩下的时间里的注意力都被赚取收入和消费商品和服务所占用，剩下的注意力可以自由分配的时间相对较少。对整个人类来说，可用的注意力也有一个硬性限制--正如我之前所说，我们正在走向人口高峰，到那时，我们将不再通过增加人口来增加潜在的可用注意力的总量。

Crucially, we cannot go back in time and change our past attention, either as individuals or collectively. A student who walks into an exam unprepared cannot revisit the preceding weeks and study more. A world that enters a pandemic unprepared is not able to go back in time and do more research on coronaviruses.

最重要的是，我们不能回到过去，改变我们过去的注意力，无论是作为个人还是集体。一个没有准备好就去参加考试的学生，无法重温之前的几周，并进行更多的学习。一个在毫无准备的情况下进入大流行病的世界，无法回到过去，对冠状病毒做更多的研究。

## Individual Attention Scarcity 
## 个人注意力的稀缺性 

First, let’s consider attention at the individual level. The need for meaning is no longer being met because most people are failing to give enough attention to the crucial questions of purpose at a time of great transition.

首先，让我们考虑一下个人层面上的注意力。对意义的需求不再得到满足，因为大多数人在一个巨大的过渡时期未能对目的的关键问题给予足够的关注。

In recent times, all over the world, people had become used to constructing meaning around their jobs and beliefs, but both are undermined by digital technologies. Many jobs have come under pressure from automation or outsourcing. Meanwhile, ideas, images, and information are no longer contained by geographic boundaries, and people are increasingly exposed to opinions and behaviors that diverge from their core beliefs. In combination, these challenges are leading to a crisis of identity and meaning. This crisis can take many different forms, including teenage depression, adult suicide—in the US, particularly among middle-aged white men —and fatal drug overdoses (Rodrick, 2019; American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, 2019). Between 2006 and 2019, these problems increased by 99 percent, 26 percent and 43 percent respectively.

近来，在世界各地，人们已经习惯于围绕他们的工作和信仰构建意义，但这两者都被数字技术破坏了。许多工作都受到了自动化或外包的压力。同时，思想、图像和信息不再受到地理边界的限制，人们越来越多地接触到与他们的核心信仰不同的观点和行为。这些挑战结合在一起，导致了身份和意义的危机。这种危机可以有许多不同的形式，包括青少年抑郁症、成人自杀 —— 在美国，特别是在中年白人男子中 —— 以及致命的药物过量（Rodrick，2019；美国预防自杀基金会，2019）。2006 年至 2019 年期间，这些问题分别增加了 99%、26% 和 43%。

The situation is not dissimilar to the one that first occurred when people left the countryside and moved to big cities during the transition to the Industrial Age, having to give up identities that had been constructed around land and crafts (a process that has continued to play itself out throughout the world as industrialization spread). They were uprooted from their extended families and confronted with people from other regions who held different beliefs. Then too there was a marked increase in mental illness, drug abuse and suicide.

这种情况与人们在向工业时代过渡期间离开农村并迁往大城市时首次出现的情况并无二致，他们不得不放弃围绕土地和手工艺构建的身份（随着工业化的蔓延，这一过程在世界各地不断上演）。他们被赶出他们的大家庭，并与来自其他地区持有不同信仰的人面对面。然后，精神疾病、药物滥用和自杀的情况也明显增加。

The Industrial Age had little use for an individual sense of meaning—it is difficult to combine the pursuit of a strong sense of personal purpose with the repetitive operation of an industrial machine day in, day out. Early in the Industrial Age, religion continued to provide a source of meaning for most people, as a collective purpose. As the Industrial Age progressed, however, church attendance decreased, while jobs and consumption increasingly came to be seen as sources of meaning. Some of this change can be traced back to the rise of the ‘Protestant work ethic‘, which provided justification for wealth accumulation from rising professions (such as lawyers and doctors) and the managerial class. Some of it is the result of the massive growth in commercial advertising, which cleverly tied consumption to such aspirations as freedom (e.g., the infamous Camel cowboy cigarette ads) and happiness. We have come so far on that path that people now speak of “retail therapy,” the idea that you can make yourself feel better by shopping.

工业时代对个人的意义感没有什么用处 —— 很难将追求强烈的个人目的感与日复一日的工业机器的重复操作结合起来。在工业时代早期，宗教作为一种集体目的，继续为大多数人提供意义的来源。然而，随着工业时代的发展，去教堂的人减少了，而工作和消费越来越被视为意义的来源。这种变化有些可以追溯到『新教工作伦理』的兴起，它为正在崛起的职业（如律师和医生）和管理阶层的财富积累提供了理由。其中一些是商业广告大规模增长的结果，它巧妙地将消费与自由（例如臭名昭著的骆驼牌牛仔香烟广告）和幸福等愿望联系起来。我们在这条道路上走得如此之远，以至于人们现在谈论『零售疗法』，认为你可以通过购物使自己感觉更好。

As with such earlier transitions, it is not surprising that with the current digital dislocation we are yet again seeing a rise in populist leaders with simplistic messages, such as Donald Trump in the United States and Viktor Orbán in Hungary. A recent study found that the average share of the vote for populist parties throughout Europe is more than double what it was in the 1960s (Inglehart & Norris, 2016). People who lose their sense of meaning when their purpose and beliefs are challenged want to be told that things will be okay and that the answers are simple. “Make America Great Again” is one such message. These backward-looking movements promise an easy return to a glorious past. Similarly, we are once again seeing a growth in church attendance as well as in various spiritual movements, all of which promise to quickly restore individuals’ access to meaning. The alternative of creating new meaning through an individual search for purpose and the independent examination and formation of beliefs requires considerable attention. Attention which people cannot muster for reasons that we will examine in detail later in the book. 

与早期的这种过渡一样，在当前的数字失调下，我们再次看到具有简单化信息的民粹主义领导人的崛起，如美国的唐纳德·特朗普和匈牙利的维克多·欧尔班，这一点并不令人惊讶。最近的一项研究发现，整个欧洲民粹主义政党的平均得票率是 1960 年代的两倍还要多（Inglehart & Norris, 2016）。当他们的目的和信仰受到挑战时，失去意义感的人希望有人告诉他们，事情会好起来，答案很简单。『让美国再次伟大』（Make America Great Again）就是这样一个信息。这些向后看的运动承诺可以轻松回到辉煌的过去。同样地，我们再次看到教会出席率以及各种精神运动的增长，所有这些都承诺迅速恢复个人对意义的获取。通过个人对目的的寻求以及对信仰的独立审查和形成来创造新的意义，这种选择需要相当的关注。由于我们将在本书后面详细研究的原因，人们无法凝聚起注意力。

This individual scarcity of attention to purpose is not confined to any one demographic. People who work multiple jobs to pay rent and feed their families are definitely impacted, but so are many people in high-paying jobs, who are often working more hours than ever and have increased their personal expenses to the point where they cannot afford to quit. One might posit that this is the result of a lack of education, but I often meet young people who have graduated from elite schools and want to work for a technology startup or get into venture capital. Most of them are looking for advice about how to apply to a specific position. After discussing that for some time, I usually ask them a more open question: “What do you want from this position?” That often elicits more interesting answers—they might talk about learning a new skill, or applying one that they have recently learned. Sometimes people answer with a desire to contribute to some cause. When I ask them “What is your purpose?”, shockingly few have paid enough attention to this question to have an answer. It is often as if they had been presented with this question for the first time and suddenly realize that “make a lot of money” is not actually a purpose that can provide meaning in life. 

这种对目的的个人稀缺性并不局限于任何一个人口群体。为了支付房租和养家糊口而从事多份工作的人肯定会受到影响，但许多从事高薪工作的人也是如此，他们的工作时间往往比以往更长，个人开支也增加到无法辞职的地步。有人可能会认为这是缺乏教育的结果，但我经常遇到那些从名校毕业的年轻人，他们想在科技创业公司工作或进入风险投资。他们中的大多数人都在寻找关于如何申请特定职位的建议。在讨论了一段时间后，我通常会问他们一个更开放的问题。『你想从这个职位上得到什么？』这往往会引出更有趣的答案 —— 他们可能会谈论学习新技能，或应用他们最近学到的技能。有时人们的回答是希望为某些事业做出贡献。当我问他们『你的目的是什么？』时，令人震惊的是，很少有人对这个问题给予足够的重视，以至于没有答案。他们往往是第一次被问到这个问题，突然意识到『赚大钱』实际上并不是一个可以提供生活意义的目的。

## Collective Attention Scarcity 
## 集体注意力的稀缺性 

Humanity is also not devoting nearly enough attention to our collective need for more knowledge to address the threats we are facing and seize the opportunities ahead of us.

人类也没有对我们对更多知识的集体需求投入足够的关注，以应对我们所面临的威胁并抓住我们面前的机会。

In terms of the threats we face, we are not working nearly hard enough on reducing the levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Or on monitoring asteroids that could strike the Earth, and coming up with ways of deflecting them. Or on containing the current coronavirus outbreak and future pandemics (an early draft of *The World After Capital*, written before 2020, said “containing the next avian flu” here). 

就我们面临的威胁而言，我们在减少大气层中的二氧化碳和其他温室气体水平方面的工作还远远不够。或者监测可能袭击地球的小行星，并想出偏转它们的方法。或者在遏制目前的冠状病毒爆发和未来的大流行病上（《资本之后的世界》的早期草稿，写于 2020 年之前，这里原本说的是『遏制下一次禽流感』）。

Climate change, “death from above” and pandemics are three examples of species-level threats that are facing humans. As I wrote earlier, we are only able to sustain the current global human population due to technological progress. Each of these risk categories has the potential to fundamentally disrupt our ability to meet individual needs. For example, the climate crisis could result in large-scale global crop failures, which could mean we would no longer be able meet everyone’s needs for calories and nutrients. This is not a hypothetical concern: it has led to the downfall of prior human civilizations, such as the Rapa Nui on Easter Island and the Mayans, whose societies collapsed due to relatively small changes in their local climate, possibly induced in some measure by their own actions (White, 2019; Simon, 2020; Seligson, 2019). Now we are facing a climate crisis on a truly global scale, and we should be using a significant proportion of all human attention to fight this threat.

气候变化、『来自上面的死亡』和大流行病是人类面临的物种级威胁的三个例子。正如我之前写的，由于技术进步，我们只能维持目前的全球人类人口。这些风险类别中的每一个都有可能从根本上扰乱我们满足个人需求的能力。例如，气候危机可能导致大规模的全球作物歉收，这可能意味着我们将不再能够满足每个人对卡路里和营养物质的需求。这不是一个假设性的担忧：它已经导致了之前人类文明的衰落，如复活节岛的拉帕努伊人和玛雅人，他们的社会由于当地气候相对较小的变化而崩溃，可能在某种程度上是由他们自己的行为引起的（White，2019；Simon，2020；Seligson，2019）。现在，我们正面临着真正的全球规模的气候危机，我们应该用人类所有注意力的很大一部分来对抗这一威胁。

> 译注：『来自上面的死亡』，来自 1979 年的电影《末日降临》（[The Apocalypse Now](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078788/)，该片被中译为《现代启示录》—— 我猜片名翻译者是把 Apocalypse 这个词意思硬往宗教意义上理解去了……）。片中比尔上校的直升机上刷着这个标语。另外，二战末期，美国空军的第七轰炸队（7<sup>th</sup> Bomb Wing）的机身上，也写着这个标语的拉丁语版：*Mors Ab Alto*。从上下文语境上来看，『来自上面的死亡』这个词汇，作者指的应该是现代战争。

On the opportunity side, far too little human attention is spent on things such as environmental cleanup, educational resources and basic research. The list here is nearly endless, and includes unlocking quantum computing and advancing machine intelligence. The latter is particularly intriguing because it could help produce more knowledge faster, thus potentially helping to reduce the scarcity of attention.

在机会方面，人类在环境清理、教育资源和基础研究等方面的关注太少。这里的清单几乎是无穷无尽的，包括解锁量子计算和推进机器智能。后者特别引人注意，因为它可以帮助更快地产生更多的知识，从而有可能帮助减少注意力的稀缺性。

None of this means that everyone has to become a scientist or engineer—there are many other ways to allocate attention to address these threats and opportunities. For instance, learning about the climate crisis, sharing that knowledge with others and becoming politically active are all ways of allocating attention that can directly or indirectly create more knowledge. So is creating art that inspires others, whether it is to directly take an action, or by connecting us to our shared humanity as a source of meaning. This is why when I talk about not creating enough knowledge, I am not limiting it to scientific knowledge but including all knowledge, as defined earlier.

这并不意味着每个人都必须成为科学家或工程师 —— 还有许多其他方式来分配注意力，以应对这些威胁和机会。例如，学习关于气候危机的知识，与他人分享这些知识，并成为政治上的积极分子，都是分配注意力的方式，可以直接或间接地创造更多的知识。创作激发他人的艺术也是如此，无论是直接采取某种行动，还是通过将我们与我们共同的人性联系起来作为意义的来源。这就是为什么当我谈到没有创造足够的知识时，我并不局限于科学知识，而是包括前面定义的所有知识。

Attention scarcity is difficult to alleviate, and I therefore propose it as a possible explanation for the Fermi paradox. The physicist Enrico Fermi famously asked why we have not yet detected any signs of intelligent life elsewhere in our universe, despite knowing that there are plenty of planets that could harbor such life. Many different explanations have been advanced, including that we are the first and hence only intelligent species, or that more advanced intelligent species stay “dark” for fear of being attacked by even more advanced species (the premise of Cixin Liu’s sci-fi trilogy *The Three-Body Problem*). Alternatively, perhaps all civilizations develop until they have sufficient capital but then suffer from attention scarcity, so they are quickly wiped out by a pandemic or a meteor strike. If civilizations that can build radios don’t persist for very long, the timing of signs of their existence may be very unlikely to coincide with ours.

注意力稀缺是很难缓解的，因此我提出它是对费米悖论的一种可能解释。物理学家恩里科-费米（Enrico Fermi）提出了一个著名的问题：尽管我们知道有很多星球可能孕育着智能生命，但为什么我们还没有在宇宙的其他地方检测到任何智能生命的迹象。许多不同的解释已经被提出，包括我们是第一个，因此也是唯一的智能物种，或者更先进的智能物种保持 "黑暗"，因为害怕被更先进的物种攻击（刘慈欣的科幻三部曲*《三体问题》的前提）。或者，也许所有的文明都发展到拥有足够的资本，但随后却遭受到注意力的稀缺，所以它们很快就被一场大流行病或流星撞击消灭了。如果能够建造收音机的文明不会持续很长时间，那么它们存在的迹象的时间可能非常不可能与我们的相吻合。


Why is our scarce attention so poorly allocated that we have created a potential extinction-level event in the form of a climate crisis? One reason is that we currently use the market mechanism to allocate attention. The next sections explain how this mechanism is sucking huge amounts of attention into a few systems such as Facebook, while also keeping much of it trapped in Industrial Age activities. Finally, we will consider why markets fundamentally cannot allocate attention, which points to crucial limits of capitalism.

为什么我们稀缺的注意力分配得如此糟糕，以至于我们以气候危机的形式创造了一个潜在的灭绝级事件？其中一个原因是，我们目前使用市场机制来分配注意力。接下来的章节将解释这一机制是如何将大量的注意力吸进少数几个系统，如 Facebook，同时也将大部分注意力困在工业时代的活动中。最后，我们将考虑为什么市场从根本上不能分配注意力，这指出了资本主义的关键限制。
