# The Misallocation of Attention Through Digital Technology
# 数字技术带来的注意力错误分配

We have seen that attention is scarce relative to the great problems and opportunities facing us, making proper allocation of available attention the crucial challenge for humanity. As we will see later, digital technology can help meet this challenge. But in the recent past the primary effect of digital technology has been to misallocate attention.

我们已经看到，相对于我们面临的巨大问题和机会，注意力是稀缺的，这使得适当分配现有的注意力成为人类的关键挑战。正如我们稍后所见，数字技术可以帮助应对这一挑战。但在最近，数字技术的主要影响是错误地分配注意力。

The Internet is exponentially increasing the amount of available content. Most of the recorded content produced by humanity has been produced in the last few years, a natural result of fast exponential growth in the creation of data (Marr, 2019). As a result, it is easy to be overwhelmed. Our limited attention is easily absorbed by the increasing amount of content tailored to piquing our curiosity and capturing our attention. Humans are inadequately adapted to the information environment we now live in. Checking email, Twitter, Instagram, and watching yet another YouTube clip or Snapchat story provide ‘information hits’ that trigger the parts of our brain that evolved to be stimulated by novelty, social connection, sexual attractiveness, animal cuteness, and so on. For hundreds of thousands of years, when you saw a cat (or a sexy person) there was an actual cat (or sexy person) somewhere nearby. Now the Internet can provide you with an effectively unlimited stream of cat (or sexy person) pictures. In 2019, the average person spent nearly two and a half hours on social media every day, part of a staggering 10 and a half hours spent on some sort of media consumption, or more than 60 percent of all waking hours (Kemp, 2020; "The Nielsen Total Audience Report," 2020). 

互联网正在以指数形式增加可用的内容。人类生产的大部分记录内容都是在过去几年里产生的，这是数据创造快速指数增长的自然结果（Marr，2019）。因此，我们很容易被淹没。我们有限的注意力很容易被越来越多为激起我们的好奇心和吸引我们的注意力而定制的内容所吸收。人类没有充分适应我们现在生活的信息环境。检查电子邮件 、Twitter、Instagram，以及观看另一个 YouTube 短片或 Snapchat 故事，这些都提供了『信息点击』，触发了我们大脑中进化为被新奇、社会联系、性吸引力、动物可爱等等所刺激的部分。几十万年来，当你看到一只猫（或一个性感的人），附近就有一只真实的猫（或性感的人）。现在，互联网可以为你提供有效的无限的猫（或性感的人）图片流。2019 年，平均每人每天在社交媒体上花费近两个半小时，这是花费在某种媒体消费上的惊人的 10 个半小时的一部分，或超过所有清醒时间的 60%（Kemp，2020；《尼尔森总受众报告》，2020）。

Importantly, the dominant companies that we use to access this information, such as Google, Facebook and Twitter, generate most of their revenues by capturing and reselling our attention. That’s the essence of advertising, which is their business model. Advertisers literally buy our attention. Today, in order to grow, these companies invest in algorithms designed to present highly targeted, captivating content, thereby capturing more of our attention. News sites like Buzzfeed and the Huffington Post do the same.

重要的是，我们用来获取这些信息的主导公司，如 Google 、Facebook 和 Twitter，通过捕捉和转售我们的注意力获得了大部分收入。这就是广告的本质，这也是他们的商业模式。广告商实际上是在购买我们的注意力。今天，为了发展，这些公司投资于旨在呈现高度针对性、吸引人的内容的算法，从而吸引我们更多的注意力。像 Buzzfeed 和 Huffington Post 这样的新闻网站也是如此。

It is much easier to capture attention by appealing to the parts of our brain that find kittens cute, people sexy, and react with outrage to perceived offenses rather than asking us to read a long-form essay or work through an argument by independently weighing evidence. The companies responsible for these systems lack financial incentives to persuade you to close your computer, put down your smartphone and spend more time with family and friends, read a book, or go outdoors and enjoy, or even clean up, the environment. The financial markets closely track metrics such as number of users and time spent on a platform, which are predictors of future growth in advertising revenue. In other words, the markets that drive the predominant way we use digital technology to allocate attention reflect the financial interests of investors and advertisers, which are often orthogonal or even antagonistic to individual and community interests. As we will see later (see the section on “Missing Prices” below) the problem runs even deeper, as it is actually *impossible* to construct proper markets for attention.

通过吸引我们大脑中认为小猫可爱、人们性感以及对感知到的冒犯作出愤怒反应的部分，而不是要求我们阅读一篇长篇文章或通过独立权衡证据来解决一个论点，来吸引注意力要容易得多。负责这些系统的公司缺乏经济激励，无法说服你关闭电脑，放下智能手机，花更多时间与家人和朋友在一起，读一本书，或到户外享受，甚至清理环境。金融市场密切跟踪用户数量和在一个平台上花费的时间等指标，这些都是预测未来广告收入增长的指标。换句话说，推动我们使用数字技术分配注意力的主要方式的市场，反映了投资者和广告商的财务利益，而这些利益往往与个人和社区利益正交，甚至是对立的。正如我们稍后将看到的（见下文『缺失的价格』一节），问题甚至更深，因为实际上构建适当的注意力市场是**不可能的**。
