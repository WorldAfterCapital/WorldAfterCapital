# Limits Of Capitalism
# 资本主义的局限性

Capitalism has been so successful that even theoretically communist countries like China have embraced it. But it cannot solve the scarcity of attention without significant changes in regulation, because of three important limitations. First, prices will always be missing for things that we should be paying attention to. Second, capitalism has limited means for dealing with the concentration in wealth and market power arising from digital technologies. Third, capitalism acts to preserve the interests of capital over knowledge. We need to make changes now, precisely because capitalism has been so successful—the problems that are left are the ones it cannot solve.

资本主义是如此成功，甚至理论上像中国这样的共产主义国家也接受了它。但是，如果不对监管进行重大改变，它无法解决注意力的稀缺问题，因为有三个重要的限制。首先，对于我们应该关注的东西，价格总是会缺失。第二，资本主义在处理数字技术带来的财富和市场力量的集中方面手段有限。第三，资本主义的行为是为了维护资本对知识的利益。我们现在需要做出改变，正是因为资本主义已经如此成功--剩下的问题是它无法解决的问题。
 
## Missing Prices 
## 缺失的价格 

Capitalism won’t help us allocate attention because it relies on prices that are determined in markets. Prices are powerful because they efficiently aggregate information about consumer preferences and producer capabilities, but not everything can be priced. And increasingly, the things that cannot be priced are becoming more important than those that can: for example, the benefits of space exploration, the cost of the climate crisis, or an individual’s sense of purpose.

资本主义不能帮助我们分配注意力，因为它依赖于市场中决定的价格。价格是强大的，因为它们有效地汇总了关于消费者偏好和生产者能力的信息，但不是所有的东西都能被定价。而且，不能被定价的东西正变得比能被定价的东西更重要：例如，太空探索的好处，气候危机的代价，或个人的使命感。

The lack of prices for many things is not just a question of a missing market that can be created through regulation. The first foundational issue is the zero marginal cost of copies and distribution in the digital realm. From a social perspective, we should make all the world’s knowledge, including services such as medical diagnoses, available for free at the margin. But this means that as long as we rely on the price mechanism, we will under-produce digital resources. Just as the Industrial Age has been full of negative externalities such as pollution, resulting in overproduction, the Knowledge Age is full of positive externalities, such as learning, which implies underproduction. If we rely on the market mechanism, we will not pay nearly enough attention to the creation of free educational resources. 

许多东西没有价格，不仅仅是一个可以通过监管创造的市场缺失的问题。第一个基础性问题是数字领域的拷贝和传播的零边际成本。从社会角度来看，我们应该让世界上所有的知识，包括医疗诊断等服务，在边际上免费提供。但这意味着，只要我们依赖价格机制，我们就会对数字资源的生产不足。正如工业时代充满了负面的外部性，如污染，导致生产过剩，知识时代充满了正面的外部性，如学习，这意味着生产不足。如果我们依赖市场机制，我们就不会对免费教育资源的创造给予足够的重视。

The second foundational issue is uncertainty. Because prices aggregate information, they fail when no such information exists. When events are either incredibly rare or have never occurred, we have no information on their frequency or severity, and the price mechanism cannot work when forecast error is infinite. For instance, large asteroid impacts on Earth occur millions of years apart, and hence no price can help us allocate attention to detecting them and building systems to deflect them. As a result, we pay a trivial amount of attention to such problems relative to the potential damage they would cause. 

第二个基础性问题是不确定性。因为价格是信息的集合体，所以当不存在这种信息时，价格就会失效。当事件极其罕见或从未发生过时，我们没有关于其频率或严重性的信息，当预测误差为无限时，价格机制就无法发挥作用。例如，大型小行星对地球的撞击相隔数百万年，因此没有价格可以帮助我们分配注意力来检测它们，并建立系统来抵御它们。因此，相对于它们可能造成的损失，我们对这类问题的关注微不足道。

The third foundational issue is new knowledge. The further removed such knowledge is from creating a product or service that can be sold, the less use the price mechanism is. Consider early aviation pioneers, for example. They pursued flight because they were fascinated by solving a challenge rather than because there was an obvious market for air travel. Or take the early days of quantum computing: actual machines were still decades away, so at that time the price mechanism would not have allocated attention to the discipline. Much of this knowledge therefore needs to be produced by allocating attention through other mechanisms, such as government funded research, academic institutions, and prizes.

第三个基础性问题是新知识。这种知识离创造可以销售的产品或服务越远，价格机制的作用就越小。例如，考虑到早期的航空先驱者。他们追求飞行是因为他们对解决一个挑战感到着迷，而不是因为航空旅行有一个明显的市场。或者以早期的量子计算为例：实际的机器离我们还有几十年的时间，所以在那个时候，价格机制不会把注意力分配给这门学科。因此，大部分知识需要通过其他机制分配注意力来产生，如政府资助的研究、学术机构和奖项。

The fourth foundational issue is that in order for markets and prices to exist, there have to be multiple buyers (demand) and sellers (supply). There is no demand and supply for you to spend time with your children or to figure out your purpose in life. Capitalism cannot help us allocate attention to anything that is deeply personal.

第四个基础问题是，为了使市场和价格得以存在，必须有多个买家（需求）和卖家（供应）。对于你花时间与你的孩子在一起或弄清你的生活目的，没有需求和供应。资本主义不能帮助我们把注意力分配到任何深入个人的事情上。

A way of summarizing all of these examples is to think of the world as divided into an economic sphere (where prices exist) and a non-economic one. Market-based allocation of attention can only succeed in the former and, to the extent that there are insufficient counterweights, will do so at the detriment of attention allocated to the non-economic sphere. This is the high earning parent, who doesn’t spend enough time with their children, or the legions of science PhDs optimizing ad algorithms instead of working on the climate crisis.

总结所有这些例子的方法是，把世界划分为经济领域（存在价格）和非经济领域。基于市场的注意力分配只能在前者成功，而且，如果没有足够的抗衡力量，就会损害分配到非经济领域的注意力。这就是高收入的父母，他们没有花足够的时间与他们的孩子在一起，或者大量的科学博士在优化广告算法，而不是致力于解决气候危机。

## Power Laws 
## 权力法则 

When it comes to the distribution of income and wealth, many different outcomes are possible, and what actually happens depends both on the underlying production function and government regulation. Consider a manual production function that was common before industrialization. If you were a cobbler making shoes by hand, for instance, there was a limit to the number of shoes you could produce.

当涉及到收入和财富的分配时，有许多不同的结果是可能的，而实际发生的情况既取决于基本的生产函数，也取决于政府监管。考虑一下工业化之前常见的手工生产功能。例如，如果你是一个手工制鞋的鞋匠，你能生产的鞋的数量是有限制的。

Then along came industrialization and economies of scale. If you made more cars, say, you could make them more cheaply. That is why, over time, there were relatively few car manufacturers around the world and the owners of the surviving ones had large fortunes. Still, these manufacturing businesses stayed fairly competitive with each other even as they grew large, which limited their market power and thereby the amount of wealth that they generated. Many service businesses have relatively small economies of scale, which has allowed a great many of them to exist, and markets such as nail salons and restaurants have remained highly competitive. Finance is one clear exception to this among services. A few large banks, insurance companies and brokerage firms tend to dominate the finance industry, and that has accelerated in recent years, largely because financial services have already been heavily impacted by digital technology.

然后，工业化和规模经济随之而来。如果你制造更多的汽车，比如说，你可以更便宜地制造它们。这就是为什么随着时间的推移，世界各地的汽车制造商相对较少，而幸存的汽车制造商的所有者拥有大量财富。不过，这些制造业企业即使在发展壮大的过程中也保持着相当的竞争性，这限制了他们的市场力量，从而限制了他们所创造的财富数量。许多服务企业的规模经济相对较小，这使得许多企业得以存在，美甲店和餐馆等市场一直保持高度竞争。金融业是服务业中的一个明显例外。少数大型银行、保险公司和经纪公司往往在金融业中占主导地位，而且近年来这种情况在加速发展，主要是因为金融服务已经受到数字技术的严重影响。

With digital technology we are seeing a shift to ever-higher market power and wealth concentration. When you plot the outcomes, such as companies by revenue, the resulting curves look like so-called ‘power laws’: the biggest firm is a lot bigger than the next biggest firm, which in turn is a lot bigger than the third largest, and so on. This pattern is pervasive throughout digital technology and the industries in which it plays a major role. For instance, the most watched video on YouTube has been watched billions of times, while the vast majority of videos have been watched just a few times. In e-commerce, Amazon is an order of magnitude larger than its biggest competitor, and several orders of magnitude larger than most e-commerce companies. The same goes for apps: the leading ones have hundreds of millions of users, but the vast majority have just a few. 

随着数字技术的发展，我们看到了一个向更高的市场力量和财富集中的转变。当你绘制结果时，例如按收入计算的公司，所产生的曲线看起来像所谓的『权力法则』：最大的公司比下一个最大的公司大得多，而下一个公司又比第三大公司大得多，以此类推。这种模式普遍存在于整个数字技术和它发挥主要作用的行业。例如 ，YouTube 上观看次数最多的视频已经被观看了数十亿次，而绝大多数的视频只被观看了几次。在电子商务领域，Amazon 比其最大的竞争对手大一个数量级，比大多数电子商务公司大几个数量级。应用程序也是如此：领先的应用程序有数以亿计的用户，但绝大多数的应用程序只有几个。

Digital technologies are driving these power laws due to zero marginal cost, as explained earlier, as well as through network effects. Network effects occur when a service gets better for all participants as more people or companies join the service. For example, as Facebook grew, both new and early users had more people they could connect with. This means that once a company grows to a certain size it becomes harder and harder for new entrants to compete, as their initially smaller networks offer less benefit to participants. In the absence of some kind of regulation, the combination of zero marginal cost with network effects results in extremely lopsided outcomes. So far, we have seen one social network, Facebook, and one search company, Google, dominate all others.

如前所述，由于零边际成本，以及通过网络效应，数字技术正在推动这些动力法则。当一项服务随着更多的人或公司加入而对所有参与者变得更好时，就会出现网络效应。例如，随着 Facebook 的发展，新用户和早期用户都有更多的人可以与他们联系。这意味着，一旦一个公司发展到一定规模，新进入者就越来越难竞争，因为他们最初较小的网络给参与者带来的好处较少。在没有某种监管的情况下，零边际成本与网络效应的结合导致了极其不平衡的结果。到目前为止，我们已经看到一个社交网络 Facebook 和一个搜索公司 Google 主导了所有其他网络。

This shift to power laws is driving a huge increase in wealth and income inequality, to levels that are even beyond the previous peak of the early 1900s. Inequality beyond a certain level is socially corrosive, as the wealthy start to live in a world that is disconnected from the problems faced by large parts of the population.

这种权力法则的转变正在推动财富和收入不平等的巨大增长，其水平甚至超过了二十世纪初的前一个高峰。超过一定水平的不平等是对社会的腐蚀，因为富人开始生活在一个与大部分人口所面临的问题脱节的世界中。

Beyond the social implications of such inequality, the largest digital companies also wield undue political and market power. When Amazon acquired a relatively small online pharmacy, signaling its intent to compete in that market, there was a dramatic drop in the market capitalization of pharmacy chains. Historically, market power produced inefficient allocations due to excessive rents as prices were kept artificially high. In digital markets, in contrast, powerful companies have often pushed prices down or even made things free. While this appears positive at first, the harm to customers comes via reduced innovation, as companies and investors stop trying to bring better alternative products to market (consider, for example, the lack of innovation in Internet search). 

除了这种不平等的社会影响，最大的数字公司还拥有不适当的政治和市场力量。当 Amazon 收购了一家相对较小的网上药店，表明其有意在该市场竞争时，连锁药店的市值出现了大幅下降。从历史上看，由于价格被人为地保持在高位，市场力量产生了过度的租金，导致了低效的分配。相反，在数字市场上，强大的公司往往将价格压低，甚至让东西免费。虽然这起初看起来是积极的，但对客户的伤害是通过减少创新来实现的，因为公司和投资者不再尝试将更好的替代产品推向市场（例如，考虑到互联网搜索中缺乏创新）。

Joseph Schumpeter coined the term “creative destruction” to describe the way in which entrepreneurs create new products, technologies, methods, and ultimately economic structures to replace old ones (Kopp, 2021). Indeed, if you look at the dominant companies today, such as Google, Amazon and Facebook, they are all relatively new having displaced in importance those of the Industrial Age. However, such ‘Schumpeterian' innovation will be more difficult going forward, if not downright impossible. During the Industrial Age, machines served a specific purpose, which meant that when a new product or manufacturing technology became available, the installed base of machines became essentially worthless. Today, general-purpose computers can easily implement a new product, add a feature or adopt a new algorithm. Furthermore, production functions with information as a key input have a property known as ‘supermodularity’: the more information you have, the higher the marginal benefit of additional information (Wenger, 2012). This gives the incumbent companies tremendous sustained power—they gain more marginal value from a new product or service than a new entrant does. 

约瑟夫·熊彼特创造了『创造性破坏』一词，以描述企业家创造新产品、新技术、新方法以及最终取代旧的经济结构的方式（Kopp, 2021）。事实上，如果你看看今天占主导地位的公司，如 Google、Amazon 和 Facebook，它们都是相对较新的，在重要性上取代了工业时代的公司。然而，这种『熊彼特式的创新』在未来将更加困难，如果不是完全不可能的话。在工业时代，机器服务于一个特定的目的，这意味着当一个新的产品或制造技术出现时，机器的安装基础基本上变得毫无价值。今天，通用计算机可以很容易地实现一个新产品，增加一个功能或采用一个新算法。此外，以信息为关键输入的生产函数有一个被称为『超模数』的属性：你拥有的信息越多，额外信息的边际效益就越高（Wenger，2012）。这给了在位公司巨大的持续能力 —— 他们从一个新产品或服务中获得的边际价值比新进入者要多。

## Self-Conservation 
## 自我保护

Toward the end of the Agrarian Age, when land was scarce, political elites came from the landowning classes, and their influence wasn’t truly diminished until after the Second World War. Now, although we have reached the end of the time of capital scarcity, political elites largely represent the interests of capital holders. In some countries, such as China, senior political leaders and their families own large parts of industry outright. In other countries such as the United States, politicians are heavily influenced by the owners of capital because of the need to raise funds, the impact on policy of lobbyists, ’think tanks’ and foundations backed by capital, the skewing of public debate through capital-owned media (e.g. FOX), as well as global ’regulatory competition’ allowing capital owners to play governments off against one another in order to limit wealth redistribution through taxation. Consider just lobbying: over a five-year period, the 200 most politically active companies spent nearly $6 billion to influence policy (Allison & Harkins, 2014). A clever study from 2019 showed how this kind of lobbying directly impacts the language of laws subsequently drafted by lawmakers (O’Dell & Penzenstadler, 2019).

在土地稀缺的农业时代末期，政治精英来自地主阶级，他们的影响力直到第二次世界大战后才真正减弱。现在，虽然我们已经到了资本稀缺时代的尾声，但政治精英们在很大程度上代表了资本持有者的利益。在一些国家，如中国，高级政治领导人和他们的家人直接拥有大量的产业。在其他国家，如美国，政治家受到资本所有者的严重影响，因为需要筹集资金，游说者、『智囊团』和由资本支持的基金会对政策的影响，通过资本拥有的媒体（如 FOX）对公共辩论的歪曲，以及全球『监管竞争』允许资本所有者将政府相互竞争，以便通过税收限制财富再分配。仅考虑游说：在五年期间，政治上最活跃的 200 家公司花费了近 60 亿美元来影响政策（Allison & Harkins, 2014）。2019 年的一项巧妙研究表明，这种游说如何直接影响立法者随后起草的法律语言（O'Dell & Penzenstadler, 2019）。

The net effect of all of this are policies that are favorable to owners of capital, such as low rates of capital gains tax. Low corporate tax rates, with loopholes that allow corporations to accumulate profits in countries where taxes are low, are also favorable to owners of capital. This is why in many countries we have some of the lowest effective tax rates for corporations and wealthy individuals and families in history (‘effective’ means what is paid after exemptions and other ways of reducing or avoiding tax payments). 

所有这些的净效果都是有利于资本所有者的政策，如低资本收益税率。低的公司税率，以及允许公司在低税率国家积累利润的漏洞，也对资本所有者有利。这就是为什么在许多国家，我们有一些公司和富有的个人以及家庭的有效税率最低（『有效』是指在豁免和其他减少或避免缴税的方式之后所支付的费用）。

In addition to preserving and creating financial benefits for the owners of capital, corporations have also attacked the creation and sharing of knowledge. They have lobbied heavily to lengthen terms of copyright and to strengthen copyright protection. And scientific publishers have made access to knowledge so expensive that libraries and universities struggle to afford the subscriptions (Sample, 2018; Buranyi, 2018). 

除了为资本所有者保留和创造经济利益外，公司还攻击了知识的创造和分享。他们为延长版权期限和加强版权保护进行了大量的游说。而科学出版商让知识的获取变得如此昂贵，以至于图书馆和大学都难以负担订阅费用（Sample，2018；Buranyi，2018）。

A key limitation of capitalism thus is that without meaningful change, it will keep us trapped in the Industrial Age by keeping governments and the political process focused on capital. As long as that is the case, we will continue to over-allocate attention to work and consumption, and under-allocate it to areas such as the individual need for meaning and the collective need for the growth of knowledge. Parts Four and Five of *The World After Capital* will examine how we can get out of the Industrial Age, but first we will take a closer look at the power of knowledge and the promise of the digital knowledge loop.

因此，资本主义的一个关键限制是，如果没有有意义的改变，它将使我们困在工业时代，使政府和政治进程专注于资本。只要这种情况存在，我们就会继续过度关注工作和消费，而对个人对意义的需求和集体对知识增长的需求等领域的关注不足。《资本之后的世界》第四和第五部分将探讨我们如何才能走出工业时代，但首先我们将仔细研究知识的力量和数字知识圈的承诺。
