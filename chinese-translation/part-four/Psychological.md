# Psychological Freedom
# 心理自由

Imagine you live in a society that has achieved economic and informational freedom. Would you make good use of those freedoms, or would your beliefs and fears hold you back from engaging in the knowledge loop? Or worse yet, would your attention be taken up by systems designed to capture it for someone else’s benefit? Would you feel free to pursue your own interests, or would your Industrial Age beliefs keep you trapped in the job loop? Would you have a strong sense of purpose, or would you feel adrift without a clear career path and a boss telling you what to do? Would you seek out new knowledge, or would you seek to confirm what you already believe? Would you feel free to create, or would you hold yourself back out of fear? And would you recognize when your attention is being manipulated? 

想象一下，你生活在一个已经实现了经济和信息自由的社会。你会好好利用这些自由吗？还是你的信仰和恐惧会让你无法参与到知识圈中？或者更糟糕的是，你的注意力会不会被旨在为别人的利益而捕获的系统所占据？你会觉得可以自由地追求自己的兴趣，还是你在工业时代的信念会让你被困在工作圈里？你会有强烈的目标感，还是会在没有明确的职业道路和老板告诉你该做什么的情况下感到漂泊不定？你会寻求新的知识，还是会寻求确认你已经相信的东西？你会感到自由地创造，还是会因为恐惧而抑制自己？你会意识到你的注意力被操纵了吗？

While the previous sections on economic and informational freedom examined changes that require collective action, this section addresses individual action. We must free ourselves from our deeply engrained Industrial Age beliefs, and we can start on that path by developing some form of mindfulness practice. This, in my view, is essential to freely directing our attention in the Knowledge Age. 

前面关于经济和信息自由的章节考察了需要集体行动的变化，而本节则涉及个人行动。我们必须把自己从根深蒂固的工业时代信仰中解放出来，我们可以通过发展某种形式的正念练习来开始这条道路。在我看来，这对于在知识时代自由地引导我们的注意力至关重要。

I should start by acknowledging the profound psychological dimension of the transition out of the Industrial Age. Social and economic disruption were making life stressful even before the Covid-19 pandemic. The unfolding climate crisis and the ongoing escalation of political and social tensions around the world are further causes for anxiety. To make matters worse, we have yet to learn to live healthily with new technology, and we obsessively check our smartphones during meetings, while driving, and before we go to sleep. This is taking an immense psychological toll, as increases in sleep disorders, suicide rates, drug overdoses and antisocial behaviors (e.g., bullying) show.

首先，我应该承认走出工业时代的过渡期所带来的深刻的心理影响。甚至在 Covid-19 大流行病之前，社会和经济的破坏就已经使生活变得紧张。正在发生的气候危机和世界各地持续升级的政治和社会紧张局势是造成焦虑的进一步原因。更糟糕的是，我们还没有学会与新技术一起健康地生活，我们在开会时、开车时和睡觉前痴迷地查看我们的智能手机。这正在造成巨大的心理损失，睡眠障碍、自杀率、药物过量和反社会行为（如欺凌）的增加都表明了这一点。

We need to go beyond that general insight about the population at large and look at what goes on in our own heads, but that requires time and effort because our brains are easily hijacked by emotional reactions that interfere with introspection and self-awareness. Can we overcome the anxieties that might prevent us from gaining, creating and sharing knowledge? Can we put down our phones, when they are designed to draw us in? It might seem like a monumental task, but humankind is uniquely adaptable. After all, we have navigated two prior transitions that required dramatic psychological change, first from the Forager Age to the Agrarian Age, and then to the Industrial Age. 

我们需要超越这种对广大民众的一般洞察力，看看我们自己头脑中的情况，但这需要时间和努力，因为我们的大脑很容易被干扰内省和自我意识的情绪反应所劫持。我们能克服可能阻碍我们获得、创造和分享知识的焦虑吗？当手机被设计用来吸引我们的时候，我们能放下手机吗？这可能看起来是一项艰巨的任务，但人类具有独特的适应能力。毕竟，我们已经经历了两次需要巨大心理变化的过渡，首先是从觅食时代到农业时代，然后到工业时代。

We now understand why humans can adapt so well. As neuroscientists have discovered, our brains remain plastic even as we age, meaning that what and how we think can be changed. In fact, we can change it quite deliberately, with techniques such as conscious breathing, meditation and cognitive behavioral therapy (McClintock, 2020; “Cognitive Behavioral Therapy,” 2020). As a crude approximation, the brain can be thought of as consisting of two systems: one that instinctually produces emotions and snap judgments and one that allows for rational thought but requires effort (Kahneman, 2013). Mindfulness techniques allow us better access to our rational faculties by limiting the extent to which our instinctual reactions control our behavior. 

我们现在明白了为什么人类可以适应得如此好。正如神经科学家所发现的那样，我们的大脑即使随着年龄的增长仍然具有可塑性，这意味着我们思考的内容和方式是可以改变的。事实上，我们可以通过有意识的呼吸、冥想和认知行为疗法等技术，相当刻意地改变它（McClintock, 2020; “Cognitive Behavioral Therapy,” 2020）。作为一个粗略的近似，大脑可以被认为是由两个系统组成：一个是本能地产生情绪和快速判断，一个是允许理性思考但需要努力的系统（Kahneman, 2013）。正念技术通过限制本能反应对我们行为的控制程度，使我们能够更好地利用我们的理性能力。

The idiom “take a deep breath” captures this idea well: pause and reflect before acting. The larger concept of deliberately freeing the mind is found in both Eastern and Western traditions. The Stoic philosophers developed practices of thought to temper the emotions, such as imagining the loss of a possession repeatedly before it occurs. In Buddhism, meditation techniques help practitioners achieve similar psychological freedom. We now have neuroscience research that lets us begin to understand how these techniques work, showing that their persistence over time is not a matter of religious belief or superstition, but grounded in the physical reality of our brains (Yoon et al., 2019).

成语『深吸一口气』（*take a deep breath*）很好地抓住了这个概念：在行动之前暂停和反思。东方和西方的传统中都有刻意解放思想的大概念。斯多葛派的哲学家们发展了思考的做法来控制情绪，例如在失去财产之前反复想象。在佛教中，冥想技术帮助修行者实现类似的心理自由。我们现在有了神经科学的研究，让我们开始了解这些技巧是如何工作的，表明它们长期存在不是宗教信仰或迷信的问题，而是基于我们大脑的物理现实（Yoon et al.，2019）。

We will now examine what we need to free ourselves *from* so that we can direct our attention to contributing to the knowledge loop and other Knowledge Age activities.

我们现在将研究我们需要把自己解放出来，以便我们能够把注意力放在为知识圈和其他知识时代的活动作出贡献上。

## Freedom from Wanting
## 免于匮乏的自由

The extraordinary success of capitalism has made us confused about work and consumption. Instead of seeing them as a means to an end, we now see them as sources of purpose in themselves. Working harder and consuming more allows the economy to grow, so that... we can work harder and consume more. Though this sounds crazy, it has become the default position. We went so far as to ingrain this view in religion, moving to a Protestant work ethic that encourages working harder and earning more (Skidelsky & Skidelsky, 2013). Similar changes have taken place throughout Asia, where other religions have undergone this transition, most prominently in the case of the “New Confucianism” as championed by Lee Kuan Yew, the founding Prime Minister of Singapore (Pezzutto, 2019).

资本主义的非凡成功使我们对工作和消费感到困惑。我们现在不再将它们视为达到目的的手段，而是将它们视为目的本身的来源。更努力的工作和更多的消费使经济增长，这样…… 我们可以更努力的工作和更多的消费。虽然这听起来很疯狂，但它已经成为默认的立场。我们甚至将这种观点根植于宗教中，转向鼓励更努力工作和赚取更多收入的新教工作伦理（Skidelsky & Skidelsky, 2013）。类似的变化也发生在整个亚洲，其他宗教也经历了这种转变，最突出的是新加坡开国总理李光耀倡导的『新儒家思想』（Pezzutto，2019）。

Even worse, we frequently find ourselves trapped in what’s known as ‘positional consumption’, or “Keeping up with the Joneses.” This is where what matters to us are not the inherent benefits of the things we buy, but their relative prestige. If our neighbor buys a new car, we find ourselves wanting an even newer and more expensive model. Such behavior has emerged not just with respect to goods but also to services—think of the $1,000 haircut or the $595-per-person dinner at a Michelin-starred restaurant (Orlo Salon, n.d.; Cross, 2020). Of course, much of this confusion has been fueled by trillions of dollars of advertising spend aimed at convincing us to buy more, flooding us with imagery of how happy we’ll be if only we do. Between economic policy, advertising and religion, it is no wonder that many people are convinced that materialism is part of human nature. 

更糟糕的是，我们经常发现自己陷入了所谓的『位置性消费』，或『跟上琼斯』。在这种情况下，对我们来说，重要的不是我们所购买的东西的内在好处，而是它们的相对声望。如果我们的邻居买了一辆新车，我们就会发现自己想买一辆更新、更贵的车型。这种行为不仅出现在商品方面，也出现在服务方面 —— 想想 1000 美元的理发或米其林星级餐厅的 595 美元/人的晚餐（Orlo Salon, n.d.; Cross, 2020）。当然，这种混乱在很大程度上是由数万亿美元的广告支出所助长的，这些广告旨在说服我们购买更多的东西，让我们充斥着如果我们这样做就会多么幸福的想象。在经济政策、广告和宗教之间，难怪许多人相信物质主义是人类本性的一部分。

However, our addiction to consumption is exactly that—an addiction that exploits a mechanism in the brain. When you desire something, a new car for instance, your brain gets a dopamine hit based on your anticipated happiness, which makes you feel good. Once you get the car, you compare it to your prior expectations. If the car turns out to be less than you expected, your dopamine levels will decrease and this can cause extreme disappointment. If your expectations are met, your dopamine levels will stay constant. Only if your expectations are exceeded will you get another hit of dopamine. Now as you get used to having the new car your expectation adjusts and so quite quickly after the initial purchase you no longer receive any new dopamine from having a new car. The unfortunate result of all this is known as the ‘hedonic treadmill.’ When your brain grows accustomed to something like a car or an apartment, then recreating the same feeling of happiness as your original anticipation for the car or apartment now requires a faster car or a bigger apartment (Szalavitz, 2017). 

然而，我们的消费成瘾正是如此 —— 一种利用大脑中的机制的成瘾。当你渴望某样东西时，例如一辆新车，你的大脑会根据你预期的幸福感获得多巴胺的冲击，这让你感觉良好。一旦你得到这辆车，你就会把它与你之前的期望进行比较。如果汽车结果不如你的预期，你的多巴胺水平就会下降，这可能导致极度失望。如果你的期望得到满足，你的多巴胺水平将保持不变。只有当你的期望值被超出时，你才会得到另一次多巴胺的冲击。现在，当你习惯于拥有新车时，你的期望值就会调整，所以在最初购买后，你很快就不再从拥有新车中获得任何新的多巴胺。这一切的不幸结果被称为『享乐主义的跑步机』。当你的大脑逐渐习惯于像汽车或公寓这样的东西时，那么重新创造与你最初对汽车或公寓的预期相同的幸福感现在需要更快的汽车或更大的公寓（Szalavitz, 2017）。

That same mechanism, however, can provide long-term motivation when the anticipation is aimed at creation or exploration instead of consumption. As an artist or scientist, you can forever seek out new subjects. As a traveler, you can forever seek out new destinations. Freedom from wanting—in the sense of the delusional belief that consumption as such will bring happiness or meaning—is possible if we recognize that we can point our brain away from consumption and towards other pursuits, many of which are part of the knowledge loop. Redirecting our reward mechanism re-establishes the difference between needs and wants. You need to eat, while you may want to eat at a Michelin-starred restaurant. You need to drink water, while you may want to drink an expensive wine. This is why UBI, as discussed earlier, focuses on meeting needs rather than wants. Once you are economically free to meet your needs and are freeing yourself from wanting, you can direct your attention to the knowledge loop. 

然而，当期待的目的是创造或探索而不是消费时，同样的机制可以提供长期的动力。作为一个艺术家或科学家，你可以永远寻找新的主题。作为一个旅行者，你可以永远寻找新的目的地。如果我们认识到我们可以把我们的大脑从消费中引向其他追求，其中许多是知识循环的一部分，那么从欲望中解脱出来 —— 即认为消费本身会带来幸福或意义的妄想 —— 是可能的。重新引导我们的奖励机制重新确立了需求和欲望之间的区别。你需要吃饭，而你可能想在米其林星级餐厅吃饭。你需要喝水，而你可能想喝一种昂贵的葡萄酒。这就是为什么 UBI，如前面所讨论的，侧重于满足需求而不是欲望。一旦你在经济上可以自由地满足你的需求，并且从欲望中解放出来，你就可以把注意力转移到知识圈上。

Suppose skiing is your passion and you want to keep seeking the perfect powder. How would a UBI let you focus your attention on it? On a UBI alone, you might not be able to afford an annual ski trip to the Swiss alps, but ski equipment is actually not expensive when you consider that it can last for many years and can be shared with others. And if you’re willing to hike up a mountain, you can ski as much as you want without buying a lift pass at an expensive resort. 

假设滑雪是你的激情所在，你想继续寻求完美的滑雪场。一个 UBI 如何让你把注意力集中在它上面？仅仅依靠 UBI，你可能无法负担每年去瑞士阿尔卑斯山滑雪的费用，但如果考虑到滑雪设备可以使用很多年，并且可以与他人分享，那么滑雪设备实际上并不昂贵。而且，如果你愿意徒步上山，你可以尽情地滑雪，而不需要在昂贵的度假村购买缆车票。

In this instance, psychological freedom means freeing yourself of assumptions that you might have about how to go skiing. It helps, of course, to remind yourself that many of these assumptions are formed by companies that have a commercial interest in portraying skiing that way. If you can learn to reframe it as an outdoor adventure and a chance to be in nature, it needn’t be expensive. A similar logic holds for any number of other activities. 

在这个例子中，心理自由意味着将自己从关于如何去滑雪的假设中解放出来。当然，提醒自己这些假设中有许多是由那些对滑雪有商业利益的公司形成的。如果你能学会把它重塑为一次户外探险和一个在大自然中的机会，它就不需要很昂贵。类似的逻辑也适用于任何数量的其他活动。

To free ourselves from wanting, we should remind ourselves of the difference between needs and wants, learn how our brain works and point our seeking away from consumption towards creative and experiential activities. For many of us, that means letting go of existing attachments to wants that we have developed over a long time. Finally, we should always cast a critical eye on the advertising we encounter, understanding that it perpetuates illusions about needs and wants and keeps us trapped in the job loop.

为了把自己从欲望中解放出来，我们应该提醒自己需要和欲望之间的区别，学习我们的大脑是如何工作的，并把我们的追求从消费指向创造性和体验性活动。对我们中的许多人来说，这意味着放下我们长期以来形成的对欲望的现有执着。最后，我们应该始终对我们遇到的广告投以批判的目光，理解它使关于需求和欲望的幻想永久化，并使我们陷于劳务循环。

## Freedom to Learn
## 学习的自由

Young children ask dozens of questions a day, often annoying their parents who don’t have the time to answer. Humans are naturally curious, and it is this curiosity that has driven much of our progress (Shin & Kim, 2019). At the same time, our curiosity was not well-suited to the Industrial Age. If you employ people in a factory job that has them performing the same action all day every day, curiosity is not a desirable trait. The same goes for many modern service jobs, such as operating a cash register or delivering packages. 

幼儿每天要问几十个问题，常常惹恼了没有时间回答的父母。人类天生具有好奇心，正是这种好奇心推动了我们的大部分进步（Shin & Kim, 2019）。同时，我们的好奇心也不太适合工业时代的发展。如果你雇用人们从事工厂工作，让他们每天都在做同样的动作，那么好奇心就不是一个理想的特质。许多现代服务工作也是如此，如操作收银机或递送包裹。

The present-day educational system was built to support the job loop of the industrial economy, so it is not surprising that it tends to suppress rather than encourage curiosity (Gatto et al., 2017). While educators hardly ever identify “suppressing curiosity” as one of their goals, many of our educational practices do exactly that. For instance, forcing every eight-year-old to learn the same things in math, teaching for tests, and cuts to music and art classes all discourage curiosity. 

当今的教育体系是为了支持工业经济的劳务循环而建立的，所以它倾向于压制而不是鼓励好奇心也就不足为奇了（Gatto et al.，2017）。虽然教育工作者几乎没有把『压制好奇』心作为他们的目标之一，但我们的许多教育实践正是这样做的。例如，强迫每个 8 岁的孩子学习相同的数学知识，为考试而教学，以及削减音乐和艺术课程，都会抑制好奇心。

A critical way that we undermine curiosity is by evaluating areas of knowledge according to whether we think they will help us get a “good job.” If your child expressed an interest in learning Swahili or wanting to play the mandolin, would you support that? Or would you say something like, “But how will you earn a living with that?” The latest iteration of this thinking is an enthusiasm for learning how to code in order to get high-paying job in tech. Here again, instead of encouraging curiosity about coding, either for its own sake or as a tool in science or art, we force it into the Industrial Age logic of the job loop.

我们破坏好奇心的一个重要方式是根据我们认为知识领域是否会帮助我们得到一份『好工作』来评估它们。如果你的孩子表示对学习斯瓦希里语或想弹曼陀林感兴趣，你会支持吗？或者你会说：『但你怎么能靠这个谋生呢？』这种思维的最新迭代是对学习代码的热情，以便在技术领域获得高薪工作。在这里，我们没有鼓励人们对编码的好奇心，无论是为了它本身还是作为科学或艺术的工具，而是把它强行纳入工业时代的劳务循环逻辑。

We need to free ourselves from this instrumental view of knowledge and embrace learning for its own sake. As we’ve already seen, UBI can go a long way in allaying fears that we won’t be able to support ourselves if we let our curiosity guide our learning. But will we have enough engineers and scientists in such a world? If anything, we’ll likely have more than we do under the current system. After all, forcing kids to study something is a surefire way to squelch their natural curiosity. 

我们需要将自己从这种工具性的知识观中解放出来，并接受为了学习而学习。正如我们已经看到的 ，UBI 可以在很大程度上减轻人们的担忧，即如果我们让好奇心引导我们的学习，我们将无法养活自己。但是，在这样一个世界里，我们会有足够的工程师和科学家吗？如果有的话，我们可能会比目前的制度下拥有更多。毕竟，强迫孩子们学习一些东西是压制他们自然好奇心的一个可靠方法。

The knowledge loop, accelerated by digital technology, brings to the fore other limits to learning that we must also overcome. The first of these is confirmation bias. As humans we find it easier to process information that confirms what we already believe to be true. We can access a huge amount of online content that confirms our pre-existing beliefs rather than learning something new. We risk becoming increasingly entrenched in these views, fracturing into groups with strong and self-reinforcing beliefs. This phenomenon becomes even more pronounced with the automatic personalization of many Internet systems, with ‘filter bubbles’ screening out conflicting information (Pariser, 2021). 

由数字技术加速的知识循环，使我们必须克服的其他学习限制凸显出来。其中第一个是确认性偏见。作为人类，我们发现更容易处理那些证实我们已经相信是真的信息。我们可以访问大量的在线内容来确认我们已有的信念，而不是学习新的东西。我们有可能变得越来越固执于这些观点，分裂成具有强烈和自我强化的信念的群体。随着许多互联网系统的自动个性化，这种现象变得更加明显，『过滤泡』将冲突的信息筛选出来（Pariser, 2021）。

Another barrier to learning is the human tendency to jump to conclusions on the basis of limited data. After a study suggested that smaller schools tended to produce better student performance than larger schools, educators began to create a lot of smaller schools, only for a subsequent study to find that a lot of smaller schools were also doing poorly. It turns out that the more students a school has, the more likely it is to approximate the overall distribution of students. A small school is therefore more likely to have students who perform predominantly well or poorly. 

学习的另一个障碍是人类倾向于在有限的数据基础上跳出结论。在一项研究表明，规模较小的学校往往比规模较大的学校产生更好的学生成绩后，教育工作者开始创建大量的小型学校，只是在随后的研究中发现，许多小型学校也表现不佳。事实证明，一所学校的学生越多，就越有可能接近学生的整体分布。因此，一所小学校更有可能出现以表现好或表现差为主的学生。

Daniel Kahneman discusses such biases in his book *Thinking, Fast and Slow*. We rely on heuristics that result in confirmation bias and storytelling because many of the systems in the human brain are optimized for speed and effortlessness. These heuristics aren’t necessarily all bad as they can contribute to important ruin avoidance mechanisms (something which Kahneman ignores), but they served us better in a world with an analog knowledge loop, where more time existed for correcting mistakes. In today’s high-velocity digital knowledge loop, we must slow ourselves down or risk passing along incorrect stories. A recent study showed that false stories spread online many times more quickly than true ones (Vosoughi et al., 2018). 

丹尼尔·卡尼曼在他的《思考，快与慢》一书中讨论了这种偏见。我们依赖启发式方法，导致确认性偏见和讲故事，因为人类大脑中的许多系统是为速度和不费力而优化的。这些启发式方法不一定都是坏事，因为它们可以促进重要的避免毁坏的机制（卡尼曼忽略了这一点），但它们在一个有模拟知识循环的世界里对我们更好，那里有更多的时间来纠正错误。在今天的高速数字知识循环中，我们必须放慢自己的脚步，否则就有可能传递错误的故事。最近的一项研究表明，虚假故事在网上的传播速度比真实故事快很多倍（Vosoughi et al.，2018）。

The bulk of online experiences we currently interact with are designed to exploit our cognitive and emotional biases, not to help us overcome them. Companies such as Facebook and Twitter become more valuable as they capture more of our attention by appealing to what Kahneman calls “System 1”: the parts of our brain that run automatically and that are responsible for our cognitive biases (Kahneman, 2013). You are more likely to look at cute animal pictures or status updates from your friends than to read an in-depth analysis of a proposal for a carbon tax. The recent explosion of “fake news” exploits this flaw in our systems, making large-scale manipulation possible. 

我们目前与之互动的大部分在线体验都是为了利用我们的认知和情感偏见，而不是为了帮助我们克服这些偏见。诸如 Facebook 和 Twitter 这样的公司变得更有价值，因为它们通过吸引卡尼曼所说的『系统 1』来吸引我们的注意力：我们大脑中自动运行的部分，这些部分负责我们的认知偏见（Kahneman，2013）。你更有可能看可爱的动物图片或你朋友的状态更新，而不是阅读对碳税提案的深入分析。最近爆发的『假新闻』利用了我们系统中的这一缺陷，使大规模操纵成为可能。

New systems can help here. We might, for instance, imagine an online reader that presents opposing viewpoints to a given story. For each topic, you could explore both similar and opposing views. Such a reader could be presented as a browser plug-in, so that when you’ve ventured beyond the confines of a social media platform and are looking around on the Web, you could be drawn into actively exploring beyond the bounds of your usual sources (Wenger, 2011). 

新的系统在这里可以提供帮助。例如，我们可以想象一个在线阅读器，它对一个给定的故事提出相反的观点。对于每个主题，你可以探索相似和反对的观点。这样的阅读器可以以浏览器插件的形式出现，这样，当你超越了社交媒体平台的限制，在网络上四处寻找时，你可以被吸引到你通常的来源范围之外进行积极探索（Wenger，2011）。

Fundamentally though, we all have to actively work on engaging what Kahneman calls “System 2”: the part of our brain that requires effort, but that lets us think independently and rationally. Developing and keeping up some kind of mindfulness practice is a key enabler for overcoming biases and freeing ourselves to learn.

但从根本上说，我们都必须积极努力地参与卡尼曼所说的『系统 2』：我们大脑中需要努力的部分，但它让我们独立和理性地思考。培养和保持某种正念练习是克服偏见和解放自己学习的一个关键因素。

## Freedom to Create
## 创造的自由

After learning, the next step in the knowledge loop is creating. Here again, we need to work on our freedom. As Picasso once said, “Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist [...]” As adults we censor ourselves, inhibiting the natural creativity we enjoyed as children. The educational system, with its focus on preparing for standardized tests, further crushes our creative impulses. Many people eventually come to believe that creativity is something that they’re not capable of.

学习之后，知识循环的下一步是创造。在这里，我们又需要在自由上下功夫。正如毕加索曾经说过的，『每个孩子都是一个艺术家，问题是如何保持一个艺术家…… 问题是如何保持艺术家的身份…… 作为成年人，我们审查自己，抑制了我们在童年时享受的自然创造力。』教育系统以准备标准化考试为重点，进一步压制了我们的创造冲动。许多人最终相信，创造力是他们没有能力做到的事情。

The job loop further solidifies these beliefs about creativity, and even institutionalizes them. Society categorizes people into amateurs and professionals. We venerate the professional guitar player, artist or sculptor but denigrate the amateur, dismissing their work as “amateurish.” When we start to measure creativity by how much money an artist or musician makes rather than the passion they feel for a pursuit, there is no wonder that many people fear they will never measure up. 

工作圈进一步巩固了这些关于创造力的信念，甚至将其制度化。社会把人分为业余和专业。我们推崇专业的吉他手、艺术家或雕塑家，但却诋毁业余者，把他们的作品斥为『业余』。当我们开始用艺术家或音乐家赚多少钱来衡量创造力，而不是用他们对某项追求的热情来衡量，难怪许多人担心他们永远无法达到这个标准。

Distractions also inhibit our impulses to create. There’s always another YouTube video to watch, another email to read, another post to glance at. Our brains are poorly suited to environments that are overloaded with information specifically curated to capture our attention. We evolved in a world where potentially relevant information—for instance, the sound of an approaching animal—could be a matter of life or death, and our brains are thus easily distracted. This is an example of a maladaptation to the current environment akin to our evolutionary craving for sugar in a world with added sugar everywhere. 

分散注意力也抑制了我们创造的冲动。总是有另一个 YouTube 视频要看，另一个电子邮件要读，另一个帖子要看。我们的大脑很不适合那些专门为吸引我们的注意力而策划的超负荷信息环境。我们在一个潜在的相关信息--例如，一个接近的动物的声音--可能是一个生死攸关的问题的世界中进化，因此我们的大脑很容易分心。这是一个不适应当前环境的例子，类似于我们在进化过程中对糖的渴望，而这个世界到处都有加糖。

In order to be able to create, we need to disconnect ourselves from many of those strategically selected and concentrated stimuli. Again, a mindfulness practice will be helpful here, allowing us to tune out interruptions, and there are many hacks we can use to prevent them in the first place, such as putting our phone into Do Not Disturb (DND) mode (I keep my phone on DND at all times with only family members being able to get through—that way I use my phone when I want to and not when Facebook or Twitter want me to).

为了能够进行创作，我们需要将自己与许多有策略地选择和集中的刺激断开。同样，正念练习在这里会有帮助，使我们能够调出干扰，而且有许多小技巧我们可以用来首先防止它们，比如把我们的手机调到勿扰（DND）模式（我的手机一直保持在 DND 模式，只有家人能够打通，这样我想用手机的时候就用，而不是 Facebook 或 Twitter 要我用的时候）。

## Freedom to Share
## 分享的自由

Even after we have created something, many of us fear that when we share it, it will be criticized. Someone will call our painting ugly, our code incompetent, or our proposal naive. Given the state of much online commentary and the prevalence of ‘trolling,’ those fears are well-founded—but they need not inhibit our participation in the knowledge loop. Part of the answer is to work on the inner strength to continue sharing despite criticism.
 
即使在我们创造了一些东西之后，我们中的许多人都担心，当我们分享它时，它会被批评。有人会说我们的画很丑，我们的代码不称职，或者我们的建议很天真。考虑到许多在线评论的状况和『托钓』的盛行，这些担心是有根据的，但它们不需要抑制我们对知识循环的参与。答案的一部分是努力获得内在的力量，在批评声中继续分享。

Another part of the answer is that we should cultivate empathy. Whenever we comment on the work of others online, we should keep in mind that they dared to create and share it. And we should also remember that by contributing to the knowledge loop, they have engaged in the very thing that makes us human. Those who manage online communities should provide tools for flagging and banning people who are abusive or make threats aimed at shutting down sharing. 

答案的另一部分是，我们应该培养同理心。每当我们在网上评论别人的作品时，我们应该牢记他们敢于创造和分享这些作品。我们还应该记住，通过对知识圈的贡献，他们参与了使我们成为人类的事情。那些管理网络社区的人应该提供工具来标记和禁止那些滥用或威胁要关闭分享的人。

If you live in a country that is subject to dictatorship, censorship or mob rule, sharing opinions, art or research can result in imprisonment, torture or even death. And yet despite that, we routinely find people who freely share in these places. We should take inspiration and courage from those people, and we should support people’s ability to build systems to enable sharing in these places that are censorship-resistant and that allow for pseudonymous and anonymous expression (even though these systems ultimately can provide only limited protection, as discussed in the earlier section on privacy). 

如果你生活在一个受独裁统治、审查制度或暴民统治的国家，分享意见、艺术或研究可能导致监禁、酷刑甚至死亡。然而尽管如此，我们还是经常发现在这些地方有自由分享的人。我们应该从这些人身上得到启发和勇气，我们应该支持人们建立系统的能力，以便在这些地方实现抗审查和允许假名和匿名表达的分享（尽管这些系统最终只能提供有限的保护，正如前面关于隐私的部分所讨论的）。

In the Knowledge Age, there is such a thing as sharing too much—not sharing too much personal information, but mindlessly sharing harmful information. Threats, rumors and lies can take on lives of their own, and we can find ourselves contributing to an information cascade, in which an initial bit of information picks up speed and becomes an avalanche that destroys everything in its path. So, as with freedom in other contexts, there’s a double-edged aspect to having the psychological freedom to share. We need to free ourselves from fear to share our creations and our ideas, while also needing to control our emotional responses so that we do not poison the knowledge loop. Ask yourself whether what you’re sharing will enhance or hurt the pursuit of knowledge. If the answer is not obvious, it might be better not to share.

在知识时代，有这样一种现象：分享太多 —— 不是分享太多个人信息，而是无意识地分享有害信息。威胁、谣言和谎言可以有自己的生命，我们可以发现自己对信息瀑布的贡献，在这种情况下，最初的一点信息会加速，变成雪崩，摧毁其路径上的一切。因此，与其他情况下的自由一样，拥有分享的心理自由也有一个双刃剑的方面。我们需要把自己从恐惧中解放出来，以分享我们的创作和想法，同时也需要控制我们的情绪反应，以便我们不会毒害知识循环。问问自己，你所分享的东西是会提高还是会损害对知识的追求。如果答案不明显，也许不分享更好。

## Psychological Freedom and Humanism
## 心理自由和人文主义

Self-regulation lies at the heart of psychological freedom, and allows us to separate our wants from our needs. It lets us consider our initial reactions to what others are saying, writing or doing without immediately reacting in anger. It lets us have empathy for others and to be open to learning something new. And it lets us overcome our fears of creating and sharing.
 
自我调节是心理自由的核心，它使我们能够将我们的需求与我们的需要分开。它让我们考虑自己对他人所说、所写或所做的最初反应，而不立即做出愤怒的反应。它让我们对他人有同情心，并乐于学习新的东西。它还让我们克服对创造和分享的恐惧。
 
Still, as humans we have a need for meaning that has us searching for purpose and recognition in ways that can all too easily result in us being psychologically unfree. Existential angst can express itself in many different forms, ranging from an inability to do anything to a manic desire to do everything. The persistence of religion is partly explained by its ability to address the need for meaning. Most religions claim that our purpose is to follow a set of divinely ordained rules, and that if we follow them, the respective god or gods will recognize and potentially even reward our existence. 

然而，作为人类，我们有一种对意义的需求，这使我们在寻找目的和认可的过程中，很容易导致我们心理上的不自由。存在主义的焦虑可以以许多不同的形式表现出来，从什么都做不了到什么都想做的狂躁欲望。宗教的持续存在，部分原因是它能够解决对意义的需求。大多数宗教声称，我们的目的是遵循一套神圣的规则，如果我们遵循这些规则，各自的神将承认甚至有可能奖励我们的存在。

Many organized religions intentionally disrupt the knowledge loop. They restrict the process of critical inquiry by which knowledge improves over time, through mechanisms such as censorship and “divine knowledge,” which is often encoded in sacred texts. This serves to maintain the power of the gatekeepers to the texts and their interpretation. While adhering to a religion may meet your existential psychological need for meaning, it may also make it difficult for you to participate fully and freely in the knowledge loop. 

许多有组织的宗教有意扰乱知识循环。他们通过审查和『神圣的知识』等机制，限制了知识随着时间的推移而改进的批判性探究过程，而这些知识往往被编码在神圣的文本中。这有助于维护文本及其解释的看门人的权力。虽然坚持宗教可能会满足你对意义的存在心理需求，但它也可能使你难以完全自由地参与到知识圈中。

The same is true for many informal beliefs. Belief in a preordained individual destiny can be used to fulfill the need for meaning, but it also acts as an obstacle to psychological freedom via thoughts such as “this was meant to be, there’s nothing I can do about it.” Or people can belong to communities that meet the need for meaning through recognition, but impose a strict conformity that restricts participation in the knowledge loop. It can often be difficult to recognize how much of one’s behavior is controlled by custom or peer pressure. 

许多非正式的信仰也是如此。对预设的个人命运的信仰可以用来满足对意义的需求，但它也通过『这是注定的，我无能为力』这样的想法成为心理自由的障碍。或者人们可以属于那些通过承认来满足意义需求的社区，但却强加了严格的一致性，限制了对知识循环的参与。要认识到一个人的行为有多少是由习俗或同伴压力控制的，往往是很困难的。

A new humanism, built around recognizing the importance of knowledge, can provide an alternative that enhances psychological freedom instead of inhibiting it. With participation in the knowledge loop as a key source of purpose, learning new things, being creative and sharing with others is encouraged. This doesn’t mean that everyone has to be the proverbial rocket scientist. There are a great many ways to participate in the knowledge loop, including creating art, as well as caring for others and the environment. 

围绕着承认知识的重要性而建立的新人文主义，可以提供一种增强心理自由而不是抑制心理自由的替代方案。以参与知识循环作为目标的关键来源，学习新事物、发挥创造力和与他人分享是被鼓励的。这并不意味着每个人都必须成为传说中的火箭科学家。有很多方法可以参与知识循环，包括创造艺术，以及关心他人和环境。

In order to help people be psychologically free, we need to substantially change most countries’ education systems. Today’s systems were developed to support the Industrial Age, and their goal is to shape people to participate in the job loop. We need a system that celebrates knowledge for its own sake, allows students to discover their individual interests and deepen those into a purpose, and teaches people about how to be psychologically free. In other words, we need to put humanism at the center of learning. 

为了帮助人们获得心理上的自由，我们需要大幅改变大多数国家的教育系统。今天的系统是为支持工业时代而开发的，其目标是塑造人们参与劳务循环。我们需要一个为知识本身而赞美的系统，允许学生发现他们的个人兴趣，并将其深化为一个目标，并教导人们如何在心理上获得自由。换句话说，我们需要将人文主义置于学习的中心。

Humanism and the knowledge loop thus have important implications for how we can reorganize society and take responsibility for the world around us. This is the subject of Part Five.

因此，人文主义和知识圈对我们如何重组社会和对我们周围的世界负责有重要的影响。这就是第五部分的主题。
