# Informational Freedom
# 信息化的自由

Can you read any book you want to at the push of a button? Can you listen to any music ever recorded the moment you feel like it? Do you have instant access to any academic publication from around the world that you wish to consult? In the past, when copying and distributing information was expensive, asking such seemingly outrageous questions would not have made any sense. In the early days of writing, when books were copied by hand, they were rare, costly and subject to errors. Very few people had access to them. And even as recently as the last years of the 20th century, it typically took physically costly processes of production and distribution to get books, musical recordings and other items into people’s hands.

你能在按下按钮时阅读任何你想读的书吗？你能在你想听的时候听任何曾经录制的音乐吗？你能即时获得你想查阅的世界各地的任何学术出版物吗？在过去，当复制和传播信息的成本很高时，问这种看似离谱的问题是没有任何意义的。在写作的早期，当书籍被手工复制时，它们是罕见的，昂贵的，而且会有错误。很少有人能接触到它们。即使在最近的二十世纪最后几年，要把书本、音乐唱片和其他物品送到人们手中，通常需要花费大量的物理生产和分配过程。

But in the digital age, when the marginal cost of making and distributing a copy has shrunk to zero, all limitations on digital information are artificial. They involve adding costs to the system in order to impose scarcity on something that is abundant. For example, billions of dollars have been spent on preventing people from copying and sharing digital music files (CBS News, 2001). 

但在数字时代，当制作和分发一份拷贝的边际成本已经缩减到零时，对数字信息的所有限制都是人为的。它们涉及到给系统增加成本，以便对丰富的东西施加稀缺性。例如，为了防止人们复制和分享数字音乐文件，已经花费了数十亿美元（CBS News，2001）。

Why are we spending money to make information less accessible? When information existed only in analog form, the cost of copying and distributing it allowed us to build an economy and a society that was based on information scarcity. A record label, for instance, had to recruit musical talent, record in expensive studios, market the music, and make and distribute physical records. Charging for the records allowed the label to cover its costs and turn a profit. Now that individuals can make music on a laptop and distribute it for free, the fixed costs are dramatically lower and the marginal cost of each listen is zero. In this context, the business model of charging per record, per song or per listen, and the copyright protections required to sustain it, no longer make sense. Despite the ridiculous fight put up by the music industry, our listening is generally either free (meaning that it is ad-supported) or part of a subscription. In either case, the marginal cost of each listen is zero. 

为什么我们要花钱让信息更难获取？当信息只以模拟形式存在时，复制和传播信息的成本使我们能够建立一个基于信息稀缺性的经济和社会。例如，一个唱片公司必须招募音乐人才，在昂贵的录音室录音，推销音乐，并制作和分发实体唱片。对唱片的收费使唱片公司能够支付其成本并实现盈利。现在，个人可以在笔记本电脑上制作音乐并免费分发，固定成本大大降低，每次收听的边际成本为零。在这种情况下，按唱片、按歌曲或按收听次数收费的商业模式，以及维持这种模式所需的版权保护，不再有意义了。尽管音乐产业进行了荒谬的斗争，但我们的收听通常要么是免费的（意味着它是广告支持的），要么是订阅的一部分。在这两种情况下，每次收听的边际成本都是零。

Despite this progress in the music industry, we accept many other artificial restrictions on information access because this is the only system we know. To transition into the Knowledge Age, however, we should strive for an increase in informational freedom. This is not unprecedented in human history: prior to the advent of the printing press, stories and music were passed on orally or through copying by hand. There were no restrictions on who could tell a story or perform a song. 

尽管在音乐行业取得了这一进展，我们还是接受了许多其他对信息获取的人为限制，因为这是我们唯一知道的系统。然而，为了过渡到知识时代，我们应该努力增加信息自由。这在人类历史上并非没有先例：在印刷术出现之前，故事和音乐是通过口头或手抄的方式传递的。对于谁能讲故事或表演歌曲，没有任何限制。

To be clear, information is not the same as knowledge. Information, for instance, includes the huge number of log files generated every day by computers around the world, many of which may never be analyzed. We don’t know in advance what information will turn out to be the basis for knowledge, so it makes sense to retain as much information as possible and make access to it as broad as possible. This section will explore various ways in which we can expand informational freedom, the second important step that will facilitate our transition to a Knowledge Age. 

说白了，信息不等同于知识。例如，信息包括世界各地的计算机每天产生的大量日志文件，其中许多可能永远不会被分析。我们事先不知道哪些信息会变成知识的基础，所以尽可能多地保留信息并使其获得尽可能广泛的访问是有意义的。本节将探讨我们可以扩大信息自由的各种方式，这是促进我们向知识时代过渡的第二个重要步骤。

## Access to the Internet
## 接入互联网

The Internet has been derided by some who claim it is a small innovation compared to, say, electricity or vaccinations—but they are mistaken. The Internet allows anyone, anywhere in the world, to learn how electricity or vaccinations work. Setting aside artificial limitations imposed on the flow of information, the Internet provides the means to access and distribute all human knowledge to all of humanity. As such, it is the crucial enabler of the digital knowledge loop. Access to the Internet is a core component of informational freedom.

互联网被一些人嘲笑，他们声称与电力或疫苗接种等相比，互联网是一个小的创新 —— 但他们错了。互联网允许任何人，在世界任何地方，了解电力或疫苗的工作原理。抛开对信息流的人为限制，互联网提供了向全人类获取和传播所有人类知识的手段。因此，它是数字知识圈的重要推动者。访问互联网是信息自由的核心组成部分。

At present, over four and half billion people are connected to the Internet, a number that is increasing by hundreds of millions every year (Kemp, 2020). This tremendous growth has become possible because the cost of access has fallen dramatically. A capable smartphone costs less than $100 to manufacture. In places with competitive markets, 4G bandwidth is provided at prices as low as $0.10 per GB (Roy, 2019). 

目前，有超过 45 亿人连接到互联网，这个数字每年都在以数亿的速度增长（Kemp，2020）。这种巨大的增长之所以成为可能，是因为接入的成本已经大幅下降。一部有能力的智能手机的制造成本不到 100 美元。在有竞争性市场的地方，提供 4G 带宽的价格低至每 GB 0.10 美元（Roy, 2019）。

Even connecting people who live in remote parts of the world is getting much cheaper, as the cost for wireless networking is decreasing and we are increasing our satellite capacity. For instance, there is a project underway to connect rural communities in Mexico for less than $10,000 per community (Rostad, 2018). At the same time, in highly developed economies such as the US, ongoing technological innovation such as MIMO wireless technology will further lower prices for bandwidth in densely populated urban areas (“MIMO,” 2020). 

即使是连接生活在世界偏远地区的人，也变得更加便宜，因为无线网络的成本正在下降，我们正在增加我们的卫星容量。例如，有一个项目正在进行，以每个社区不到 10,000 美元的价格连接墨西哥的农村社区（Rostad，2018）。同时，在美国等高度发达的经济体，正在进行的技术创新，如 MIMO 无线技术，将进一步降低人口稠密的城市地区的带宽价格（"MIMO"，2020）。

All of this means that even at relatively low levels, UBI would cover the cost of Internet access, provided that we keep innovating and maintain highly competitive and properly regulated markets for access to it. This is an example of how the three different freedoms reinforce each other: economic freedom allows people to access the Internet, which is the foundation for informational freedom, and, as we will see later, using it to contribute to the knowledge loop requires psychological freedom. 

所有这些都意味着，即使在相对较低的水平上 ，UBI 也会覆盖互联网接入的成本，只要我们不断创新，并保持高度竞争和适当监管的市场来访问它。这是三个不同的自由如何相互促进的例子：经济自由使人们能够访问互联网，这是信息自由的基础，而且，正如我们稍后看到的，使用它来促进知识循环需要心理自由。

As we work to make affordable Internet access universal, we must also address limitations to the flow of information on the network. In particular, we should fight against restrictions on the Internet imposed by governments and Internet service providers (ISPs). Both are artificial limitations, driven by a range of economic and policy considerations opposed to the imperative of informational freedom. 

在我们努力普及可负担得起的互联网接入时，我们也必须解决网络信息流动的限制。特别是，我们应该与政府和互联网服务提供商（ISP）对互联网的限制作斗争。这两种限制都是人为的，是由一系列与信息自由的必要性相对立的经济和政策考虑驱动的。

## One Global Internet
## 一个全球互联网

By design, the Internet has no built-in concept of geography. Most fundamentally, it constitutes a way to connect networks with one another (hence its name), regardless of where the machines involved are located. Any geographic restrictions have been added in, often at great cost. Australia and the UK have recently mandated so-called ‘firewalls’ around their countries, not unlike China’s own “Great Firewall” (“Great Firewall,” 2020), and countries like Turkey have had one in place for some time. These ‘firewalls’ place the Internet under government control, restricting informational freedom. For instance, Wikipedia was not accessible in Turkey for many years. Furthermore, both China and Russia have banned the use virtual private network services, tools that allow individuals to circumvent these artificial restrictions (Wenger, 2017). As citizens, we should be outraged that governments are cutting us off from accessing information freely around the world, both on principle and on the basis of this being a bad use of resources. Imagine governments in an earlier age spending taxpayer money so citizens could dial fewer phone numbers.

根据设计，互联网没有内在的地理概念。最根本的是，它构成了一种将网络相互连接的方式（因此而得名），而不管相关的机器位于何处。任何地理上的限制都是被添加进去的，往往要付出巨大的代价。澳大利亚和英国最近强制要求在其国家周围建立所谓的『防火墙』，与中国自己的 *Great Firewall*（Great Firewall，2020）并不一样，土耳其等国家已经建立了一段时间。这些防火墙将互联网置于政府控制之下，限制了信息自由。例如，维基百科在土耳其有许多年无法访问。此外，中国和俄罗斯都禁止使用虚拟私人网络服务 —— 这是允许个人规避这些人为限制的工具（Wenger, 2017）。作为公民，我们应该对政府切断我们在世界各地自由获取信息的途径感到愤怒，这既是基于原则，也是基于这是对资源的糟糕利用。想象一下，在更早的时代，政府花纳税人的钱，让公民可以少拨一些电话号码。

## No Artificial Fast and Slow Lanes
## 没有人为的快车道或慢车道

The same equipment used by governments to impose geographic boundaries on the Internet is used by ISPs to extract more money from customers, distorting access in the process through practices including paid prioritization and zero-rating. To understand why they are a problem, let’s take a brief technical detour.

政府用来在互联网上强加地理界限的设备，也被互联网服务供应商用来从客户那里榨取更多的钱，在这个过程中，通过包括付费优先权和零等级的做法，扭曲了访问。为了理解为什么它们是一个问题，让我们在技术上做一个简短的迂回。

When you buy access to the Internet, you pay for a connection of a certain capacity. If it provides 10 megabits per second and you use that connection fully for sixty seconds, you would have downloaded (or uploaded, for that matter) 600 megabits, the equivalent of 15–25 songs on Spotify or SoundCloud (assuming 3–5 megabytes per song). The fantastic thing about digital information is that all bits are the same. It doesn’t matter whether you accessed Wikipedia or looked at pictures of kittens: you’ve paid for the bandwidth, and you should be free to use it to access whatever parts of human knowledge you want. 

当你购买互联网接入时，你为一定容量的连接付费。如果它提供每秒 10 兆比特，你完全使用该连接 60 秒，你将下载（或上传，为此）600 兆比特，相当于 Spotify 或 SoundCloud 上的 15-25 首歌曲（假设每首歌曲 3-5 兆比特）。数字信息的奇妙之处在于，所有比特都是一样的。你是访问维基百科还是看小猫的图片并不重要：你已经为带宽付费，你应该可以自由地使用它来访问你想要的人类知识的任何部分。

That principle, however, doesn’t maximize profit for the ISP. In order to do that, they seek to discriminate between different types of information, based on consumer demand and the supplier’s ability to pay. First they install equipment that lets them identify bits based on their origin. Then they go to a company like YouTube or Netflix and ask them to pay to have their traffic ’prioritized’ relative to traffic from other sources. Another form of manipulation that is common among wireless providers is so-called zero-rating, where some services pay to be excluded from monthly bandwidth caps. If permitted, ISPs will go a step further: in early 2017, the US Senate voted to allow them to sell customer data, including browsing history, without customer consent (Wenger, 2017). 

然而，这一原则并不能使互联网公司的利润最大化。为了做到这一点，他们试图根据消费者的需求和供应商的支付能力，对不同类型的信息进行区分。首先，他们安装设备，让他们根据其来源来识别比特。然后，他们去找 YouTube 或 Netflix 这样的公司，要求他们付费，让他们的流量相对于其他来源的流量『优先』使用。另一种常见于无线供应商的操纵形式是所谓的零费率，即一些服务付费以排除在每月带宽上限之外。如果被允许，互联网服务供应商将更进一步：2017 年初，美国参议院投票允许他们在未经客户同意的情况下出售客户数据，包括浏览历史（Wenger, 2017）。

The regulatory solution to this problem is blandly referred to as ‘net neutrality’, but what is at stake here is informational freedom itself. Our access to human knowledge should not be skewed by our ISPs’ financial incentives. We might consider switching to another ISP that provides neutral access, but in most geographic areas, especially in the United States, there is no competitive market for broadband Internet access. ISPs either have outright monopolies (often granted by regulators) or operate in small oligopolies. For instance, in the part of New York City where I live, there is just one broadband ISP. 

对这个问题的监管解决方案被平淡地称为『网络中立』，但这里的关键是信息自由本身。我们对人类知识的获取不应该被我们的互联网服务提供商的财务激励所歪曲。我们可能会考虑换成另一个提供中立访问的 ISP，但在大多数地理区域，特别是在美国，宽带互联网接入没有竞争性市场。互联网服务供应商要么拥有彻底的垄断权（通常由监管机构授予），要么在小规模的寡头垄断中运营。例如，在我居住的纽约市部分地区，只有一家宽带 ISP。

Over time, technological advances such as wireless broadband may make the market more competitive, but until then we need regulation to avoid ISPs limiting our informational freedom. This concern is shared by people all over the world: in 2016, India objected to a plan by Facebook to provide subsidized Internet access that would have given priority to their own services, and outlawed ‘zero rating’ altogether (Vincent, 2016).

随着时间的推移，无线宽带等技术进步可能会使市场更具竞争力，但在此之前，我们需要监管，以避免互联网服务提供商限制我们的信息自由。世界各地的人们都有这种担忧：2016 年，印度反对 Facebook 提供补贴互联网接入的计划，该计划将优先考虑他们自己的服务，并完全取缔了『零评级』（Vincent，2016）。


## Bots for All of Us
## 为我们所有人的机器人

Once you have access to the Internet, you need software to connect to its many information sources. When Tim Berners-Lee first invented the World Wide Web in 1989, he specified an open protocol, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), that anyone could use both to make information available and to access it ("Tim Berners-Lee," n.d.). In doing this, Berners-Lee enabled anyone to build software, so-called Web servers and browsers that would be compatible with this protocol. Many people did, including Marc Andreessen with Netscape, and many web servers and browsers were available as open-source or for free.

一旦你能进入互联网，你就需要软件来连接到它的许多信息源。当蒂姆·伯纳斯·李在 1989 年首次发明万维网时，他指定了一个开放的协议，即超文本传输协议（HTTP），任何人都可以用它来提供信息和访问信息（"Tim Berners-Lee," n.d.）。在这样做的时候，伯纳斯·李使任何人都能建立软件，即所谓的网络服务器和浏览器，与这个协议兼容。许多人这样做了，包括 Marc Andreessen 和 Netscape，许多网络服务器和浏览器都是开源的或免费的。

The combination of an open protocol and free software meant permissionless publishing and complete user control. If you wanted to add a page to the Web, you could just download a Web server, run it on a computer connected to the Internet and add content in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) format. Not surprisingly, the amount of content on the Web proliferated rapidly. Want to post a picture of your cat? Upload it to your Web server. Want to write something about the latest progress on your research project? There was no need to convince an academic publisher of its merits—you could just put up a web page. 

开放协议和自由软件的结合意味着无权限的发布和完全的用户控制。如果你想在网上添加一个页面，你只需下载一个网络服务器，在一台连接到互联网的计算机上运行，并以超文本标记语言（HTML）的格式添加内容。毫不奇怪，网络上的内容数量迅速激增。想发布一张你的猫的照片吗？把它上传到你的网络服务器。想写一些关于你的研究项目的最新进展吗？没有必要说服学术出版商相信它的价值 —— 你可以直接放上一个网页。

People accessing the Web benefited from their ability to completely control their own web browser. In fact, in the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, the web browser is referred to as a ‘user agent’ that accesses the Web on behalf of the user. Want to see the raw HTML as delivered by the server? Right click on your screen and use ‘View Page Source’. Want to see only text? Instruct your user agent to turn off all images. Want to fill out a web form but keep a copy of what you are submitting for yourself? Create a script to have your browser save all form submissions locally. 

访问网络的人得益于他们能够完全控制自己的网络浏览器。事实上，在超文本传输协议中，网络浏览器被称为『用户代理』（*user agent*），代表用户访问网络。想看看服务器交付的原始 HTML 吗？在你的屏幕上点击右键，使用『查看页面源代码』。想只看文本吗？指示你的用户代理关闭所有图像。想填写一个网络表格，但要为自己保留一份提交内容的副本？创建一个脚本，让你的浏览器在本地保存所有提交的表格。

Over time, the platforms that have increasingly dominated the Web have interfered with some of the freedom and autonomy enjoyed by early users. I went on Facebook recently to find a note I posted some time ago on a friend’s wall. But it turns out that you can’t search through all the wall posts you have written: instead you have to scroll backwards in time for each friend, trying to remember when you posted what where. Facebook has all the data, but they’ve decided not to make it searchable. Whether or not you attribute this to intentional misconduct on their part: my point is that you experience Facebook the way they want you to experience it. If you don’t like how Facebook’s algorithms prioritize your friends’ posts in your newsfeed, tough luck. 

随着时间的推移，日益主导网络的平台已经干扰了早期用户所享有的一些自由和自主权。我最近上了 Facebook，想找到我一段时间前在一个朋友的墙上发的一条信息。但事实证明，你无法搜索你写的所有墙报：相反，你必须向后滚动每个朋友的时间，试图记住你什么时候在哪里发了什么 。Facebook 拥有所有的数据，但他们决定不使其可搜索。无论你是否认为这是他们故意的不当行为：我的观点是，你体验 Facebook 的方式是他们希望你体验的。如果你不喜欢 Facebook 的算法如何在你的新闻提要中优先考虑你朋友的帖子，那么运气不好。

Imagine what would happen if everything you did on Facebook was mediated by a software program—a ‘bot’—that you could control. You could instruct it to go through and automate the cumbersome steps that Facebook lays out for finding old wall posts. Even better, if you had been using this bot all along, it could have kept your own archive of wall posts in your own data store and you could simply instruct it to search your archive. If we all used bots to interact with Facebook and didn’t like how our newsfeed was prioritized, we could ask our friends to instruct their bots to send us status updates directly, so that we could form our own feeds. This was entirely possible on the Web because of the open protocol, but it is not possible in a world of proprietary and closed apps on smartphones. 

想象一下，如果你在 Facebook 上所做的一切都由一个你可以控制的软件程序 —— 『机器人』—— 来调解，会发生什么。你可以指示它通过并自动完成 Facebook 为寻找旧墙报所规定的繁琐步骤。更好的是，如果你一直在使用这个机器人，它可以在你自己的数据存储中保存你自己的墙报档案，你可以简单地指示它搜索你的档案。如果我们都使用机器人与 Facebook 互动，并且不喜欢我们的新闻提要的优先次序，我们可以要求我们的朋友指示他们的机器人直接向我们发送状态更新，这样我们就可以形成自己的提要。这在网络上是完全可能的，因为有开放的协议，但在智能手机上的专有和封闭的应用程序的世界里，这是不可能的。

Although this example might sound trivial, bots have profound implications in a networked world. Consider the on-demand car services provided by companies such as Uber and Lyft. As drivers for these services know, each of them provides a separate app for them to use. You can try to run both apps on one phone or you can even have two phones, as some drivers do, but the closed nature of the apps means that you cannot use your phone’s computing power to evaluate competing offers. If you had access to bots that could interact with the networks on your behalf, you could simultaneously participate in these various marketplaces and play one off against the other. 

虽然这个例子听起来微不足道，但机器人在网络世界中有着深远的影响。考虑一下由 Uber 和 Lyft 等公司提供的按需用车服务。正如这些服务的司机所知，他们每个人都提供一个单独的应用程序供他们使用。你可以尝试在一部手机上运行这两个应用程序，或者你甚至可以拥有两部手机，正如一些司机所做的那样，但应用程序的封闭性意味着你无法使用手机的计算能力来评估竞争的报价。如果你有机会接触到可以代表你与网络互动的机器人，你就可以同时参与这些不同的市场，并在其中进行对抗。

Using a bot, you could set your own criteria for which rides you want to accept, including whether a commission charged by a given network was below a certain threshold. The bot would then allow you to accept only rides that maximize the fare you receive. Ride-sharing companies would no longer be able to charge excessive commissions, since new networks could arise to undercut them. Similarly, as a passenger, using a bot would allow you to simultaneously evaluate the prices between different services and choose the one with the lowest price for a particular trip. 

使用机器人，你可以为你想接受的乘车设置自己的标准，包括某个网络收取的佣金是否低于某个阈值。然后，机器人将允许你只接受能使你获得最大票价的乘车服务。共享汽车公司将不再能够收取过高的佣金，因为新的网络可能会出现，以压低他们的价格。同样，作为一名乘客，使用机器人将允许你同时评估不同服务之间的价格，并为某次旅行选择价格最低的服务。

We could also use bots as an alternative to antitrust regulation, in order to counter the power of technology giants like Google or Facebook without foregoing the benefits of their large networks. These companies derive much of their revenue from advertising, and consumers currently have no way of blocking ads on mobile devices. But what if users could control mobile apps to add ad-blocking functionality, just as they can with Web browsers? 

我们还可以利用机器人作为反垄断监管的替代方案，以对抗 Google 或 Facebook 等技术巨头的力量，同时又不放弃其大型网络的好处。这些公司的大部分收入来自广告，而消费者目前没有办法阻止移动设备上的广告。但是，如果用户可以控制移动应用，增加广告屏蔽功能，就像他们可以控制网络浏览器一样，会怎么样呢？

Many people decry ad-blocking as an attack on journalism that dooms the independent Web, but that is a pessimistic view. In the early days of the Web, it was full of ad-free content published by individuals. When companies joined in, they brought their offline business models with them, including paid subscriptions and advertising. Along with the emergence of platforms such as Facebook and Twitter with strong network effects, this resulted in a centralization of the Web—content was increasingly either produced on a platform or moved behind a paywall. 

许多人谴责广告屏蔽是对新闻业的攻击，使独立的网络走向灭亡，但这是一种悲观的看法。在网络的早期，它充满了由个人发布的无广告内容。当公司加入进来时，他们带来了他们的离线商业模式，包括付费订阅和广告。随着 Facebook 和 Twitter 等具有强大网络效应的平台的出现，这导致了网络的集中化 —— 内容越来越多地被制作在一个平台上或被移到付费墙后面。

Ad-blocking is an assertion of power by the end user, which is a good thing in all respects. Just as a New York City judge found in 2015 that taxi companies have no special right to see their business model protected from ridesharing companies (Whitford, 2015), neither do ad-supported publishers. And while this might result in a downturn for publishers in the short term, in the long run it will mean more growth for content that is paid for more directly by end users (for example, through subscriptions or crowdfunding). 

广告屏蔽是终端用户对权力的主张，这在各方面都是一件好事。正如纽约市的一位法官在 2015 年发现，出租车公司没有特殊权利看到他们的商业模式受到共享汽车公司的保护（Whitford, 2015），有广告支持的出版商也没有。虽然这在短期内可能会导致出版商的业绩下滑，但从长远来看，这将意味着由最终用户更直接付费的内容（例如，通过订阅或众筹）会有更多的增长。

To curtail the centralizing power of network effects, we should shift power to the end users by allowing them to have user agents for mobile apps, just as we did with the Web. The reason users don’t wield the same power on mobile is that native apps relegate end users to interacting with services using our eyes, ears, brain and fingers. We cannot use the computing capabilities of our smartphones, which are as powerful as supercomputers were until quite recently, in order to interact with the apps on our behalf. The apps control us, instead of us controlling the apps. Like a Web browser, a mobile user agent could do things such as block ads, keep copies of responses to services and let users participate in multiple services simultaneously. The way to help end users is not to break up big tech companies, but to empower individuals to use code that executes on their behalf. 

为了遏制网络效应的集中力量，我们应该把权力转移给最终用户，允许他们拥有移动应用的用户代理，就像我们对网络所做的那样。用户在移动端没有掌握同样的权力的原因是，原生应用程序使最终用户只能用我们的眼睛、耳朵、大脑和手指与服务进行互动。我们不能使用我们的智能手机的计算能力，这些能力在不久前还和超级计算机一样强大，以便代表我们与应用程序互动。应用程序控制我们，而不是我们控制应用程序。像网络浏览器一样，移动用户代理可以做一些事情，如阻止广告，保存对服务的反应的副本，让用户同时参与多个服务。帮助终端用户的方法不是拆散大型科技公司，而是授权个人使用代表他们执行的代码。

What would it take to make this a reality? One approach would be to require companies like Uber, Google and Facebook to expose their functionality, not just through apps and websites, but also through so-called Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). An API is what a bot uses to carry out operations, such as posting a status update on a user’s behalf. Companies such as Facebook and Twitter have them, but they tend to have limited capabilities. Also, companies have the right to shut down bots, even when a user has authorized them to act on their behalf. 

如何才能使之成为现实？一种方法是要求 Uber、Google 和 Facebook 等公司不仅通过应用程序和网站，而且通过所谓的应用程序接口（API）来公开其功能 。API 是机器人用来进行操作的，比如代表用户发布状态更新 。Facebook 和 Twitter 等公司都有，但它们的能力往往有限。此外，公司有权关闭机器人，即使是在用户授权他们代表他们行事的情况下。

Why can’t I simply write code that interfaces with Facebook on my behalf? After all, Facebook’s app itself uses an API to talk to the Facebook servers. But in order to do that I would have to hack the Facebook app to figure out what the API calls are, and how to authenticate myself to them. Unfortunately, in the US there are three separate laws that make those steps illegal. The first is the anti-circumvention provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The second is the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). And the third is the legal construction that by clicking ‘I accept’ on an End User License Agreement (EULA) or a set of Terms of Service (TOS), I am legally bound to respect whatever restrictions Facebook decides to impose. The last of these three is a civil matter, but criminal convictions under the first two laws carry mandatory prison sentences. 

为什么我不能简单地编写代码，代表我与 Facebook 对接？毕竟 ，Facebook 的应用程序本身使用 API 来与 Facebook 的服务器对话。但是，为了做到这一点，我必须入侵 Facebook 应用程序，找出 API 调用，以及如何对其进行验证。不幸的是，在美国，有三条独立的法律使这些步骤成为非法。第一条是《数字千年版权法》（DMCA）的反规避条款。第二条是《计算机欺诈和滥用法》（CFAA）。第三是法律结构，即通过点击最终用户许可协议（EULA）或一套服务条款（TOS）上的『我接受』，我在法律上必须尊重 Facebook 决定施加的任何限制。这三条中的最后一条是民事问题，但根据前两条法律进行的刑事定罪会被强制判处监禁。

If we were willing to remove these three legal obstacles, hacking an app to give programmatic access to systems would be possible. People might argue that those provisions were created to solve important problems, but that is not entirely clear. The anti-circumvention provisions of the DMCA was put in place to allow the creation of digital rights management systems for copyright enforcement. What you think of this depends on what you think about copyright, a subject we will look at in the next section. 

如果我们愿意消除这三个法律障碍，黑掉一个应用程序来给系统提供程序化的访问就有可能。人们可能会说，这些条款是为了解决重要问题而设立的，但这并不完全清楚 。DMCA 的反规避条款是为了允许建立数字版权管理系统来执行版权。你对这一点的看法取决于你对版权的看法，我们将在下一节探讨这个问题。

The scope of the CFAA could be substantially decreased without limiting its potential for prosecuting fraud and abuse, and the same goes for restrictions on usage a company might impose via a license agreement or a terms of service. If I only take actions that are also available inside the company’s app but happen to take them via a program of my own choice, why should that constitute a violation?

CFAA 的范围可以大幅缩小，但不会限制其起诉欺诈和滥用的潜力，公司可能通过许可协议或服务条款对使用的限制也是如此。如果我只采取了公司的应用程序内也有的行动，但碰巧通过我自己选择的程序采取了这些行动，为什么要构成侵权？

But, you might object, don’t companies need to protect the cryptographic keys that they use to encrypt communications? Aren’t ’botnets’ behind those infamous distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, where vast networks of computers flood a service with so many requests that no one can access it? It’s true that there are a lot of compromised machines in the world that are used for nefarious purposes, including set-top boxes and home routers. But that only demonstrates how ineffective the existing laws are at stopping illegal bots. As a result, companies have developed the technological infrastructure to deal with them. 

但是，你可能会反对，难道公司不需要保护他们用来加密通信的密码钥匙吗？那些臭名昭著的分布式拒绝服务（DDoS）攻击的背后不就是『僵尸网络』吗？诚然，世界上有很多被破坏的机器被用于邪恶的目的，包括机顶盒和家用路由器。但这只能说明现有法律在阻止非法机器人方面是多么的无效。因此，公司已经开发了技术基础设施来处理它们。

How would we prevent people from using bots that turn out to be malicious code? For one, open-source code would allow people to inspect it to make sure it does what it claims. However, open source is not the only answer. Once people can legally be represented by bots, many markets currently dominated by large companies will face competition from smaller startups that will build, operate and maintain these bots on behalf of their end users. These companies will compete in part on establishing and maintaining a trust relationship with their customers, much like an insurance broker represents a customer in relationship with multiple insurance carriers.

我们将如何防止人们使用变成恶意代码的机器人？首先，开放源代码将允许人们检查它，以确保它做它所声称的事情。然而，开放源代码并不是唯一的答案。一旦人们可以合法地由机器人代表，许多目前由大公司主导的市场将面临来自小型创业公司的竞争，这些公司将代表他们的最终用户建立、运营和维护这些机器人。这些公司的竞争部分在于建立和维护与客户的信任关系，就像保险经纪人代表客户与多家保险公司的关系一样。

Legalizing representation by bots would put pressure on the revenues of the currently dominant companies. We might worry that they would respond by slowing their investment in infrastructure, but there are contravening forces as more money will be invested in competitors. For example Uber’s ‘take rate’ (the percentage of the money paid for rides that they keep) is 25 percent. If competition forced that rate down to 5 percent, Uber’s value might fall from $90 billion to $10 billion, but that is still a huge figure, and plenty of capital would be available for investing in competitive companies that can achieve that kind of outcome. 

将机器人的代表权合法化会给目前占主导地位的公司的收入带来压力。我们可能会担心他们会通过放缓对基础设施的投资来应对，但也有相反的力量，因为更多的钱会被投资到竞争对手身上。例如 ，Uber 的『取费率』（他们保留的乘车费用的百分比）是 25%。如果竞争迫使该比率下降到 5%，那么 Uber 的价值可能会从 900 亿美元下降到 100 亿美元，但这仍然是一个巨大的数字，大量的资本将可用于投资能够实现这种结果的竞争公司。

That is not to say that there should not be limitations on bots. A bot representing me should have access to any functionality that I can access, but it should not be able to do things I can’t do, such as pretend to be another user or gain access to other people’s private posts. Companies can use technology to enforce such access limits for bots without relying on regulation that prevents bot representation in general. 

这并不是说对机器人不应该有限制。代表我的机器人应该可以访问我可以访问的任何功能，但它不应该做我不能做的事情，例如假装成另一个用户或获得其他人的私人帖子的权限。公司可以使用技术对机器人实施这种访问限制，而不需要依赖防止机器人代表的一般法规。

Even if you are now convinced of the merits of bots, you might be wondering how we will get there. The answer is that we can start very small. We could run an experiment in a city like New York, where the city’s municipal authorities control how on-demand transportation services operate. They might say, “If you want to operate here, you have to let drivers interact with your service through a program.” Given how big a market the city is, I’m confident these services would agree. Eventually we could mandate APIs for all Internet services that have more than some threshold number of users, including all the social networks and even the big search platforms, such as Google.

即使你现在对机器人的优点深信不疑，你可能想知道我们将如何达到目的。答案是，我们可以从非常小的地方开始。我们可以在纽约这样的城市进行实验，那里的市政当局控制着按需运输服务的运作方式。他们可能会说，『如果你想在这里运营，你必须让司机通过一个程序与你的服务互动』。鉴于城市是一个多么大的市场，我相信这些服务会同意。最终，我们可以为所有拥有超过一定门槛的用户的互联网服务规定 API，包括所有的社交网络，甚至大型搜索平台，如 Google。

To see that this is possible in principle, one need look no further than the UK’s Open Banking and the European Union’s Payment Services Directive, which require banks to offer an API for bank accounts (Manthorpe, 2018). This means that consumers can access third-party services, such as bill payment and insurance, by authorizing them to have access via the API instead of having to open a new account with a separate company. This dramatically lowers switching costs, and is making the market for financial services more competitive. The ACCESS Act, introduced by Senators Mark Warner and Josh Hawley in the US, was the first attempt to provide a similar concept for social media companies. While this particular effort hasn’t gone very far to date, it points to the possibility that bots could be used as an important alternative to Industrial Age antitrust regulation for shifting power back to end users.

要看到这在原则上是可行的，只需看看英国的开放银行和欧盟的支付服务指令，它们要求银行为银行账户提供一个 API（Manthorpe，2018）。这意味着消费者可以通过 API 授权第三方服务，如账单支付和保险，而不是在单独的公司开一个新账户。这大大降低了转换成本，并使金融服务市场的竞争更加激烈。美国参议员 Mark Warner 和 Josh Hawley 提出的 ACCESS 法案，是为社交媒体公司提供类似概念的首次尝试。虽然这一特殊的努力到目前为止还没有走得很远，但它指出了一种可能性，即机器人可以作为工业时代反托拉斯监管的一个重要替代方案，将权力重新转移到最终用户。

## Limiting the Limits to Sharing and Creating
## 限制分享和创造的局限性

After we have fought against geographical and prioritization limits and have bots that represent us online, we will still face legal limits that restrict what we can create and share. I will first examine copyright and patent laws and suggest ways to reduce how much they limit the knowledge loop. Then I’ll turn to privacy laws.

在我们与地域和优先权限制作斗争，并拥有代表我们在线的机器人之后，我们仍将面临限制我们可以创造和分享的法律限制。我将首先审查版权和专利法，并建议如何减少它们对知识循环的限制。然后，我将转向隐私法。

Earlier I noted how expensive it was to make copies of books when they had to be copied one letter at a time. Eventually, the printing press and movable type were invented. Together, the two made reproducing information faster and cheaper. Even back then, governments and churches saw cheaper information dissemination as a threat to their authority. In England, the Licensing of the Press Act of 1662 made the government’s approval to operate a printing press a legal requirement (Nipps, 2014). This approval depended on agreeing to censor content that was critical of the government or that ran counter to the teachings of the Church of England. The origins of copyright laws (i.e., the legal right to make copies) are thus tied up with censorship. 

早些时候我曾指出，当书籍必须一个字母一个字母地复制时，制作副本是多么昂贵。最终，印刷机和活字印刷术被发明出来。这两者结合在一起，使信息的复制变得更快、更便宜。即使在那时，政府和教会也将更便宜的信息传播视为对其权威的威胁。在英国，1662 年的《新闻出版许可法》将政府批准经营印刷厂作为一项法律要求（Nipps，2014）。这种批准取决于是否同意对批评政府或违背英国教会教义的内容进行审查。因此，版权法（即制作副本的合法权利）的起源与审查制度联系在一起。

Those who had the right to make copies, effectively had monopolies on the copyrighted content which proved to be economically attractive. Censorship, however, does not make for a popular argument to support an ongoing monopoly and so relatively quickly the argument for sustaining such an arrangement shifted to the suggestion that copyright was necessary as an inducement or incentive to produce content in the first place. The time and effort authors put into learning and writing not only made written works morally their property, the writer Daniel Defoe and others argued in the early 18th century: to motivate people to do those things, the production of “pyrated copies” had to be stopped (Deazley, 2004). While this argument sounds much more compelling than censorship, in practice, copyright was rarely held by the original creator even back then. Instead, the economic benefits of copyright have largely accrued to publishers, who for the most part acquire the copyright for a one-time payment to the author or songwriter.

那些拥有复制权的人，有效地垄断了受版权保护的内容，这证明在经济上是有吸引力的。然而，审查制度并不能成为支持持续垄断的流行论点，因此，维持这种安排的论点相对较快地转向了这样的建议，即版权作为生产内容的一种诱因或激励是必要的。作家丹尼尔· 笛福和其他人在 18 世纪初认为，作者为学习和写作所付出的时间和努力不仅使书面作品在道德上成为他们的财产：为了激励人们做这些事情，必须阻止『盗版』的生产（Deazley，2004）。虽然这个论点听起来比审查制度更有说服力，但实际上，即使在那时，版权也很少由原创作者持有。相反，版权的经济利益在很大程度上是由出版商获得的，他们在大多数情况下都是以一次性支付给作者或词曲作者的方式获得版权。

There is another problem with the incentive argument. It ignores a long history of prior content creation. Let’s take music as an example. Musical instruments were made as far back as 30,000 years ago, pre-dating the idea of copyright by many millennia. Even the earliest known encoding of a song, which marks music’s transition from information to knowledge, is around 3,400 years old (Andrews, 2018; Wulstan, 1971). Clearly then, people made and shared music long before copyright existed. In fact, the period during which it’s been possible for someone to earn a lot of money from making and then selling recorded music has been extraordinarily short. It started with the invention of the gramophone in the 1870s and peaked in 1999, the year that saw the biggest profits in the music industry, although the industry’s revenues have been gradually increasing again in recent years with the advent of streaming (Smith, 2020). 

激励的说法还有一个问题。它忽略了之前内容创作的漫长历史。让我们以音乐为例。乐器早在 3 万年前就被制造出来了，比版权的概念早了好几千年。即使是已知的最早的歌曲编码，标志着音乐从信息到知识的过渡，也有大约 3400 年的历史（Andrews，2018；Wulstan，1971）。那么显然，在版权存在之前，人们早就制作和分享了音乐。事实上，人们有可能通过制作和销售录制的音乐赚取大量金钱的时期已经特别短了。它始于 19 世纪 70 年代留声机的发明，在 1999 年达到顶峰，这一年是音乐行业利润最大的一年，尽管近年来随着流媒体的出现，该行业的收入又逐渐增加（史密斯，2020）。

Before this short period, musicians made a living either from live performances or through patronage. If copyrighted music ceased to exist, musicians would still compose, perform and record music, and they would make money in the ways that they did prior to the rise of copyright. Indeed, as Steven Johnson found when he examined this issue, that is already happening, to some degree: “the decline in recorded-music revenue has been accompanied by an increase in revenues from live music... Recorded music, then, becomes a kind of marketing expense for the main event of live shows” (Johnson, 2015). Many musicians already choose to give away digital versions of their music, releasing tracks for free on SoundCloud or YouTube and making money from performing live (which during the COVID-19 pandemic had to shift to live streaming) or through crowdfunding methods such as Kickstarter and Patreon.

在这个短暂的时期之前，音乐家们要么通过现场表演，要么通过赞助来谋生。如果受版权保护的音乐不再存在，音乐家们仍然会创作、表演和录制音乐，他们会以版权兴起之前的方式赚钱。事实上，正如史蒂文·约翰逊在研究这个问题时发现的那样，这在某种程度上已经在发生。『录制音乐收入的下降伴随着现场音乐收入的增加…… 那么，录制的音乐就成了现场演出的主要活动的一种营销费用』（Johnson，2015）。许多音乐家已经选择赠送他们音乐的数字版本，在 SoundCloud 或 YouTube 上免费发布曲目，并通过现场表演（在 COVID-19 大流行期间，不得不转向现场直播）或通过 Kickstarter 和 Patreon 等众筹方式赚钱。

Over time, copyright holders have strengthened their claims and extended their reach. For instance, with the passing of the US Copyright Act of 1976, the requirement to register a copyright was removed: if you created content, you automatically held copyright in it (U.S. Copyright Office, 2019). Then, in 1998, the US Copyright Term Extension Act extended the length of a term of copyright from 50 to 70 years beyond the life of the author. This became known as the “Mickey Mouse Protection Act” because Disney had lobbied for it: having built a profitable business based on protected content, they were mindful that a number of their copyrights were due to expire (Slaton, 1999). 

随着时间的推移，版权持有人加强了他们的主张，扩大了他们的影响。例如，随着 1976 年《美国版权法》的通过，注册版权的要求被取消：如果你创造了内容，你就自动拥有版权（美国版权局，2019 年）。然后，1998 年，美国《版权期限延长法》 将版权期限从 50 年延长到 70 年，超过了作者的寿命。这被称为『米老鼠保护法』，因为迪斯尼为此进行了游说：他们在受保护内容的基础上建立了一个有利可图的业务，他们注意到他们的一些版权即将到期（Slaton，1999）。

More recently, copyright lobbying has attempted to interfere with the publication of content on the Internet, through proposed legislation such as the Protect IP Act and the Stop Online Piracy Act, and language in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a trade deal that the United States did not ultimately join (after the United States withdrew, the language was removed). In these latest attempts at expansion, the conflict between copyright and the digital knowledge loop has become especially clear. Copyright limits what you can do with content that you have access to, essentially restricting you to consuming it. It dramatically curtails your ability to share content and to create other works that use some or all of it. Some of the more extreme examples include takedowns of videos from YouTube that used the song “Happy Birthday to You,” which was under copyright until just a few years ago. 

最近，版权游说团体试图通过《保护知识产权法》和《制止在线盗版法》等拟议立法，以及美国最终没有加入的贸易协定《跨太平洋伙伴关系协定》（TPP）中的语言，来干预互联网上的内容发布（美国退出后，该语言被删除）。在这些最新的扩张尝试中，版权和数字知识圈之间的冲突已经变得特别明显。版权限制了你能对你能接触到的内容做什么，本质上限制了你对它的消费。它极大地限制了你分享内容和创作其他使用部分或全部内容的作品的能力。一些更极端的例子包括 YouTube 上使用『祝你生日快乐』这首歌的视频被撤下，而这首歌直到几年前还受到版权保护。

From a societal standpoint, it is never optimal to prevent someone from listening to or watching content that has already been created. Since the marginal cost of accessing a digital copy is zero, the world is better off if that person gets enjoyment from that content. And if that person becomes motivated to create some new inspiring content themselves, then the world is a lot better off. 

从社会的角度来看，阻止某人收听或观看已经创造出来的内容，永远不是最佳选择。由于获取数字拷贝的边际成本为零，如果这个人从该内容中获得乐趣，世界会更好。如果这个人有动力自己创造一些新的鼓舞人心的内容，那么这个世界就会好很多。

Although the marginal cost for copying content is zero, you might wonder about the fixed and variable cost that goes into making it in the first place. If all content were to be free, then where would the money to produce it come from? Some degree of copyright is needed for content creation, especially for large-scale projects such as Hollywood movies or elaborate video games: it is likely that nobody would make them if, in the absence of copyright protection, they weren’t economically viable. Yet even for such big projects there should be constraints on enforcement. For instance, you shouldn’t be able to take down an entire service because it hosts a link to a pirated movie, as long as the link is promptly removed. More generally, I believe that copyright should be dramatically reduced in scope and made much more costly to obtain. The only automatic right accruing to content should be attribution. Reserving additional rights should require a registration fee, because you are asking for content to be restricted within the digital knowledge loop. 

虽然复制内容的边际成本为零，但你可能会想知道首先用于制作内容的固定和可变成本。如果所有的内容都是免费的，那么制作内容的钱从哪里来？内容创作需要一定程度的版权，尤其是大型项目，如好莱坞电影或精心制作的视频游戏：如果没有版权保护，在经济上不可行，很可能没有人会制作这些项目。然而，即使是这样的大项目，也应该有执法方面的限制。例如，你不应该因为一个盗版电影的链接而关闭整个服务，只要该链接被迅速删除。更为普遍的是，我认为版权的范围应该大大缩小，获得版权的成本也应该大大增加。内容唯一自动产生的权利应该是归属权。保留其他权利应该需要注册费，因为你要求内容在数字知识圈内受到限制。

Imagine a situation where the only automatic right accruing to an intellectual work was attribution. Anyone wanting to copy or distribute your song would only have to credit you, something that would not inhibit any part of the knowledge loop. Attribution imposes no restrictions on making, accessing and distributing copies, or on creating or sharing derivative works. It can include referencing who wrote the lyrics, who composed the music, who played which instrument and so on. It can also include where you found this particular piece of music. This practice of attribution is already becoming popular for digital text and images using the Creative Commons License, or the MIT License in open source software development. 

想象一下，在这种情况下，知识作品唯一自动产生的权利就是归属。任何想要复制或传播你的歌曲的人只需要归功于你，这不会妨碍知识循环的任何部分。署名对制作、获取和分发副本，或创造或分享衍生作品没有任何限制。它可以包括参考谁写的歌词、谁创作的音乐、谁演奏的乐器等等。它还可以包括你在哪里找到这段特定的音乐。在数字文本和图像方面，这种署名做法已经开始流行，使用知识共享协议，或开源软件开发中的 MIT 协议。

If you don’t want other people to use your music without paying you, you are asking for its potential contributions to the knowledge loop to be restricted, thus reducing the benefits that the loop confers upon society. You should pay for that right, which not only represents a loss to society but will also be costly to enforce. The registration fee should be paid on a monthly or annual basis, and when you stop paying it, your work should revert to attribution-only status. 

如果你不希望其他人在不付钱给你的情况下使用你的音乐，你就是要求限制它对知识循环的潜在贡献，从而减少循环赋予社会的利益。你应该为这项权利付费，这不仅是社会的损失，而且执行起来也会很费劲。注册费应该按月或按年支付，当你停止支付时，你的作品应该恢复到只归属的状态。

In order to reserve rights, you should have to register your music with a registry, with some part of the copyright fee going towards maintaining the registry. Thanks to blockchains, which allow the operation of decentralized databases that are not owned or controlled by any one entity, there can be competing registries that access the same global database. The registries would be free to search, and registration would involve a check that you are not trying to register someone else’s work. The registries could be built in a way that anyone operating a music streaming service, such as Spotify or SoundCloud, could easily implement compliance to make sure they are not freely sharing music that has reserved rights. 

为了保留权利，你应该在一个登记处注册你的音乐，版权费的一部分将用于维护登记处。由于区块链允许不为任何一个实体所拥有或控制的去中心化数据库的运作，可以有竞争性的注册机构访问同一个全球数据库。这些注册处可以自由搜索，注册时需要检查你是否试图注册别人的作品。登记处的建设方式可以使任何经营音乐流媒体服务的人，如 Spotify 或 SoundCloud，都可以很容易地实施合规性，以确保他们没有随意分享有保留权利的音乐。

It would even be possible to make the registration fee dependent on what rights you wanted to retain. For instance, your fee might be lower if you were prepared to allow non-commercial use of your music and to allow others to create derivative works, while it might increase significantly if you wanted all your rights reserved. Similar systems could be used for all types of content, including text, images and video. 

甚至有可能使注册费取决于你想保留什么权利。例如，如果你准备允许对你的音乐进行非商业性使用并允许他人创作衍生作品，你的费用可能会低一些，而如果你想保留所有的权利，费用可能会大大增加。类似的系统可用于所有类型的内容，包括文本、图像和视频。

Critics might object that the system would impose a financial burden on creators, but it is important to remember that removing content from the knowledge loop imposes a cost on society. And enforcing this removal, by finding people who are infringing and penalizing them, incurs additional costs for society. For these reasons, asking creators to pay is fair, especially if their economic freedom is already assured by UBI. 

UBI also provides an answer to another argument that is frequently wielded in support of excessive copyright: employment by publishers. This argument is relatively weak, as the major music labels combined employ only a little over twenty thousand people ("Sony Music," n.d.; “Universal Music Group,” n.d; “Warner Music Group,” n.d). On top of that, the existence of this employment to some degree reflects the societal cost of copyright. The owners, managers and employees of record labels are, for the most part, not the creators of the music. 

UBI 还为另一个经常被用来支持过度版权的论点提供了答案：出版商的就业。这个论点相对较弱，因为主要的音乐公司加起来只雇用了两万多人（《索尼音乐》，n.d.；《环球音乐集团》，n.d.；《华纳音乐集团》，n.d）。除此之外，这种就业的存在在某种程度上反映了版权的社会成本。唱片公司的老板、经理和雇员，在大多数情况下，并不是音乐的创造者。

Let me point out one more reason why a system of paid registration makes sense. No intellectual works are created in a vacuum. All authors have read books by other people, all musicians have listened to tons of music, and all filmmakers have watched countless movies. Much of what makes art so enjoyable is the existence of a vast body of art that it draws upon and can reference, whether explicitly or implicitly. We are all part of the knowledge loop that has existed for millennia. 

让我再指出一个理由，说明付费注册制度是有意义的。没有任何智力作品是在真空中产生的。所有作者都读过别人的书，所有音乐家都听过大量的音乐，所有电影制作人都看过无数的电影。艺术之所以如此令人愉快，很大程度上是由于存在大量的艺术作品，它可以明确或隐含地借鉴和参考。我们都是已经存在了几千年的知识循环的一部分。

While copyright limits our ability to share knowledge, patents limit our ability to use knowledge to create something new. Just as having a copyright confers a monopoly on the reproduction of content, a patent confers a monopoly on its application. The rationale for patents is similar to the argument for copyright: the monopoly that is granted results in profits that are supposed to provide an incentive for people to invest in research and development. 

版权限制了我们分享知识的能力，而专利则限制了我们利用知识创造新事物的能力。就像拥有版权就能垄断内容的复制一样，专利也能垄断内容的应用。专利的理由与版权的论点相似：授予的垄断导致了利润，应该为人们投资于研究和开发提供激励。

Here, as with copyright, this incentive argument should be viewed with suspicion. People invented things long before patents existed, and many have continued to invent without seeking them (Kinsella, 2013). Mathematics is a great example of the power of what is known as ‘intrinsic motivation’: the drive to do something for its own sake, and not because it will be financially rewarded. People who might have otherwise spent their time in a more lucrative way often dedicate years of their lives to work on a single mathematical problem (frequently without success). It is because of the intrinsic human drive to solve problems that the field has made extraordinary advances, entirely in the absence of patents, which thankfully were never extended to include mathematical formulas and proofs. As we will see momentarily, this problem solving drive can and has been successfully amplified through other means.

在这里，与版权一样，应该以怀疑的态度看待这种激励性的论点。早在专利存在之前，人们就已经发明了一些东西，而且很多人在没有寻求专利的情况下继续发明（Kinsella，2013）。数学是一个很好的例子，说明了所谓的 "内在动机 "的力量：为了做某事而做某事的动力，而不是因为会得到经济上的回报。那些本来可以用更有利可图的方式来打发时间的人，往往会将自己的生命奉献给一个数学问题（经常没有成功）。正是由于人类解决问题的内在动力，该领域取得了非凡的进步，完全是在没有专利的情况下，所幸的是专利的范围从未扩大到包括数学公式和证明。我们马上就会看到，这种解决问题的动力可以而且已经通过其他方式成功地放大了。

The first patent system was established in Venice in the mid-fifteenth century, and Britain had a fairly well-established system by the seventeenth (“History of Patent Law,” 2020). That leaves thousands of years of invention, a time that saw such critical breakthroughs as the alphabet, movable type, the invention of the wheel and gears. This is to say nothing of those inventors who have chosen not to patent their inventions because they saw how that would impose a loss on society. A well-known example is Jonas Salk, who created the polio vaccine. Other important inventions that were never patented include X-rays, penicillin and the use of ether as an anesthetic (Boldrin & Levine, 2010). Since we know that limits on the use of knowledge impose a cost, we should ask what alternatives to patents exist which might stimulate innovation. 

第一个专利制度于十五世纪中叶在威尼斯建立，英国在十七世纪就有了相当完善的制度（《专利法的历史》，2020）。这就留下了几千年的发明，在这个时期，出现了诸如字母、活字印刷、车轮和齿轮的发明等关键性的突破。更不用说那些选择不为其发明申请专利的发明家了，因为他们看到了这样做会给社会带来的损失。一个众所周知的例子是乔纳斯·索尔克，他创造了脊髓灰质炎疫苗。其他从未获得专利的重要发明包括 X 射线、青霉素和使用乙醚作为麻醉剂（Boldrin & Levine, 2010）。既然我们知道对知识使用的限制是有成本的，那么我们就应该问一问，除了专利，还有什么替代办法可以刺激创新。

Many people are motivated by wanting to solve a problem, whether it’s one they have themselves or something that impacts the world at large. With UBI, more of these people will be able to spend their time on inventing. We will also see more innovation because digital technologies are reducing the cost of inventing. One example of this is the company Science Exchange, which has created a marketplace for laboratory experiments. Say you have an idea that requires you to sequence a bunch of genes. The fastest gene sequencing available is from a company called Illumina, whose fastest machines used to cost more than $0.5 million to buy (Next Gen Seek, 2021). Through Science Exchange, however, you were able to access such a machine for less than $1,000 per use (“Illumina Next Generation Sequencing,” 2021). Furthermore, the next generation of sequencing machines is on the way, and these will further reduce the cost—technological deflation at work. 

许多人的动机是想解决一个问题，无论是他们自己的问题还是影响整个世界的问题。有了 UBI，这些人中更多的人将能够把时间花在发明上。我们还将看到更多的创新，因为数字技术正在减少发明的成本。这方面的一个例子是 Science Exchange 公司，它为实验室实验创建了一个市场。假设你有一个想法，需要你对一堆基因进行测序。目前最快的基因测序是来自一家名为 Illumina 的公司，其最快的机器过去需要花费 50 多万美元来购买（Next Gen Seek, 2021）。然而，通过科学交易所，你能够以每次不到 1000 美元的价格获得这样的机器（《Illumina 下一代测序》，2021）。此外，下一代测序机即将问世，这些机器将进一步降低成本--技术通缩的作用。

A lot of legislation has significantly inflated the cost of innovation. In particular, FDA rules around drug trials have made drug discovery prohibitively expensive, with the cost of bringing a drug to market exceeding $1 billion. While it is obviously important to protect patients, there are novel statistical techniques that would allow for smaller and faster trials (Berry et al., 2010). A small step was taken recently with the compassionate use of not-yet-approved drugs for fatally ill patients. Excessive medical damage claims have presented another barrier to innovation. As a result of these costs, many drugs are either not developed at all or are withdrawn from the market, despite their efficacy. For example, the vaccine against Lyme disease, Lymerix, is no longer available for humans following damage claims (Willyard, 2019). 

很多立法大大抬高了创新的成本。特别是，美国食品和药物管理局围绕药物试验的规定使药物发现的成本过高，将一种药物推向市场的成本超过 10 亿美元。虽然保护病人显然很重要，但有一些新的统计技术可以使试验规模更小、速度更快（Berry et al.，2010）。最近采取了一小步，对患有致命疾病的病人同情地使用尚未批准的药物。过度的医疗损害赔偿是创新的另一个障碍。由于这些费用，许多药物要么根本没有开发，要么从市场上撤下来，尽管它们有疗效。例如，预防莱姆病的疫苗 Lymerix 在损害索赔后不再用于人类（Willyard，2019）。

Patents are not the only way to incentivize innovation. Another historically successful strategy has been the offering of prizes. In 1714, Britain famously offered rewards to encourage a solution to the problem of determining a ship’s longitude at sea. Several people were awarded prizes for their designs of chronometers, lunar distance tables and other methods for determining longitude, including improvements to existing methods. Mathematics provides an interesting example of the effectiveness of prizes, which beyond money also provide recognition. In addition to the coveted Fields Medal for exceptional work by mathematicians under the age of 40, there are also the seven so-called Millennium Prize Problems, each with a $1 million reward (only one of which has been solved to date—and Grigori Perelman, the Russian mathematician who solved it, famously turned down the prize money opting only for the recognition). 

专利并不是激励创新的唯一方式。历史上另一个成功的策略是提供奖品。1714 年，英国为鼓励解决在海上确定船只的经度问题而提供了著名的奖励。一些人因为设计了天文钟、月球距离表和其他确定经度的方法（包括对现有方法的改进）而获得了奖励。数学界提供了一个有趣的例子，说明奖项的有效性，除了金钱之外，它还提供了认可。除了为 40 岁以下的数学家的特殊工作颁发令人羡慕的菲尔兹奖之外，还有七个所谓的千年奖问题，每个问题都有 100 万美元的奖励（迄今为止，只有一个问题被解决了，解决这个问题的俄罗斯数学家格里戈里·佩雷尔曼拒绝了奖金，只选择了认可）。

At a time when we wish to accelerate the knowledge loop, we must shift the balance towards knowledge that can be used freely. The success of recent prize programs, such as the X Prizes, the DARPA Grand Challenge and NIST competitions, is promising, and the potential exists to crowdfund future prizes. Medical research should be a particular target for prizes, to help bring down the cost of healthcare. 

在我们希望加速知识循环的时候，我们必须将平衡点转向可以自由使用的知识。最近的奖项计划，如 X 奖 、DARPA 大挑战和 NIST 竞赛的成功是有希望的，并且存在为未来的奖项进行众筹的可能性。医学研究应该是一个特别的奖励目标，以帮助降低医疗成本。

Though prizes can help accelerate the knowledge loop, that still leaves a lot of existing patents in place. I believe much can be done to make the system more functional, in particular by reducing the impact of so-called non-practicing entities (NPEs, commonly referred to as “patent trolls”). These companies have no operating business of their own, and exist solely for the purpose of litigating patents. They tend to sue not just a company but also that company’s customers, forcing a lot of companies into a quick settlement. The NPE then uses the settlement money to finance further lawsuits. Fortunately, a recent Supreme Court ruling placed limits on where patent lawsuits can be filed, which might curtail the activity of NPEs (Liptak, 2017). 

虽然奖金可以帮助加速知识循环，但这仍然留下了大量的现有专利。我相信可以做很多事情来使这个系统更加有效，特别是通过减少所谓的非执业实体（NPEs，通常被称为『专利巨头』）的影响。这些公司没有自己的经营业务，只为诉讼专利而存在。他们往往不仅起诉一家公司，还起诉该公司的客户，迫使很多公司快速和解。然后 ，NPE 用和解的钱来资助进一步的诉讼。幸运的是，最高法院最近的一项裁决对可以提起专利诉讼的地方进行了限制，这可能会遏制 NPE 的活动（Liptak，2017）。

As a central step in patent reform, we must make it easier to invalidate existing patents, while at the same time making it more difficult to obtain new ones. We have seen some progress on both counts in the US, but there is still a long way to go. Large parts of what is currently patentable should be excluded from patentability, including university research that has received even small amounts of public funding. Universities have frequently delayed the publication of research in areas where they have hoped for patents that they could subsequently license out, a practice that has a damaging impact on the knowledge loop. 

作为专利改革的核心步骤，我们必须使现有的专利更容易无效，同时使获得新专利更加困难。在美国，我们已经在这两方面取得了一些进展，但仍有很长的路要走。目前可申请专利的大部分内容应被排除在专利之外，包括接受过哪怕是少量公共资金的大学研究。大学经常推迟发表他们希望获得专利的领域的研究，并随后将其许可出去，这种做法对知识循环产生了破坏性影响。

We have also gone astray in our celebration of patents as a measure of technological progress, when we should instead treat them at best as a necessary evil. Ideally, we would roll back the reach of existing patents and raise the bar for new ones, while also inducing as much unencumbered innovation as possible through prizes and social recognition.

我们在庆祝专利作为技术进步的衡量标准时也误入歧途，而我们最多只能将其视为一种必要的罪恶。理想情况下，我们会缩小现有专利的范围，提高新专利的门槛，同时通过奖励和社会认可，尽可能多地诱导不受约束的创新。

## 克服隐私

Copyrights and patents aren’t the only legal limitations that slow down the digital knowledge loop. We’re also actively creating new restrictions in the form of well-intentioned privacy regulations. Not only do these measures restrict informational freedom, but as I will argue below, in the long run privacy is fundamentally incompatible with technological progress. Instead of clinging to our current conception of privacy, we therefore need to understand how to be free in a world where information is widely shared. Privacy has been a strategy for achieving and protecting freedom. To get over this idea while staying free, we need to expand economic, informational and psychological freedom.
 
版权和专利并不是拖累数字知识循环的唯一法律限制。我们也在积极地以善意的隐私条例的形式创造新的限制。这些措施不仅限制了信息自由，而且正如我将在下面论证的那样，从长远来看，隐私从根本上说是与技术进步不相容的。因此，我们不应固守目前的隐私概念，而是需要了解如何在一个信息广泛共享的世界里获得自由。隐私一直是实现和保护自由的一种策略。为了克服这种想法，同时保持自由，我们需要扩大经济、信息和心理自由。
 
Before I expand on this position, let me first note that countries and individuals already take dramatically different approaches to the privacy of certain types of information. For example, for many years Sweden and Finland have published everyone’s tax return, and some people, including the Chief Information Officer and Dean for Technology at Harvard Medical School, have published their entire medical history on the Internet (Doyle & Scrutton, 2016; Zorabedian, 2015). This shows that under certain conditions it is eminently possible to publicly share exactly the type of information that some insist must absolutely remain private. As we will see, such sharing turns out not only to be possible but also extremely useful.

在我阐述这一立场之前，请允许我首先指出，国家和个人已经对某些类型的信息的隐私采取了截然不同的方法。例如，多年来，瑞典和芬兰公布了每个人的纳税申报单，有些人，包括哈佛医学院的首席信息官和技术院长，在互联网上公布了他们的全部病史（Doyle & Scrutton, 2016; Zorabedian, 2015）。这表明，在某些条件下，完全有可能公开分享一些人坚持必须绝对保持隐私的信息类型。正如我们将看到的，这种共享不仅是可能的，而且是非常有用的。

To better understand this perspective, compare the costs and benefits of keeping information private with the costs and benefits of sharing it widely. Digital technology is dramatically shifting this tradeoff in favor of sharing. Take a radiology image, for example. Analog X-ray technology produced an image on a physical film that had to be developed, and could only be examined by holding it up against a backlight. If you wanted to protect the information on it, you would put it in a file and lock it in a drawer. If you wanted a second opinion, you had to have the file sent to another doctor by mail. That process was costly, time-consuming and prone to errors. The upside of analog X-rays was the ease of keeping the information secret; the downside was the difficulty of putting it to use. 

为了更好地理解这一观点，请比较保持信息隐私的成本和收益与广泛分享信息的成本和收益。数字技术正在极大地改变这种有利于共享的权衡。以放射学图像为例。模拟 X 射线技术在物理胶片上产生的图像必须被冲洗，并且只能通过将其放在背光下检查。如果你想保护上面的信息，你会把它放在一个文件里并锁在抽屉里。如果你想获得第二种意见，你必须把文件邮寄给另一位医生。这个过程成本高，耗时长，而且容易出错。模拟 X 射线的优点是容易保持信息的机密性；缺点是难以将其投入使用。

Now compare analog X-rays to digital X-rays. You can instantly walk out of your doctor’s office with a copy of the digital image on a thumb drive or have it emailed to you, put in a Dropbox or shared in some other way via the Internet. Thanks to this technology, you can now get a near-instant second opinion. And if everyone you contacted was stumped, you could post the image on the Internet for everyone to see. A doctor, or a patient, or simply an astute observer, somewhere in the world may have seen something similar before, even if it is incredibly rare. This has happened repeatedly via Figure 1, a company that provides an image sharing network for medical professionals. 

 现在将模拟 X 射线与数字 X 射线相比较。你可以立即带着优盘上的数字图像副本走出你的医生办公室，或者把它通过电子邮件发给你，放在 Dropbox 中，或者通过互联网以其他方式共享。由于这项技术，你现在可以得到一个近乎即时的第二意见。如果你联系的每个人都被难住了，你可以把图像发布在互联网上，让大家都看到。世界上某个地方的医生或病人，或者仅仅是一个精明的观察者，可能曾经看到过类似的东西，即使它是非常罕见的。这种情况已经通过图 1 多次发生，图 1 是一家为医疗专业人士提供图像共享网络的公司。

But this power comes at a price: protecting your digital X-ray image from others who might wish to see it is virtually impossible. Every doctor who looks at the image could make a copy—for free, instantly and with perfect fidelity—and send it to someone else. And the same goes for others who might have access to the image, such as your insurance company. 

但这种能力是有代价的： 保护你的数字 X 射线图像不被其他可能希望看到它的人看到几乎是不可能的。每个看图像的医生都可以免费地、即时地、完美地复制一份图像，并将其发送给其他人。其他可能获得图像的人也是如此，例如你的保险公司。

Critics will make claims about how we can use encryption to prevent the unauthorized use of your image, but those claims come with important caveats, and they are dangerous if pursued to their ultimate conclusion. In summary, the upside of a digital X-ray image is how easy it makes it to get help; the downside is how hard it is to protect digital information. 

批评者会提出关于我们如何使用加密来防止未经授权使用你的图像的说法，但这些说法有重要的注意事项，如果追求其最终结论，它们是危险的。总之，数字 X 射线图像的优点是使它很容易得到帮助；缺点是保护数字信息有多难。

But the analysis doesn’t end there. The benefits of your digital X-ray image go beyond just you. Imagine a huge collection of digital X-ray images, all labeled with diagnoses. We might use computers to search through them and get machines to learn what to look for. And these systems, because of the magic of zero marginal cost, can eventually provide future diagnoses for free. This is exactly what we want to happen, but how rapidly we get there and who controls the results will depend on who has access to digital X-ray images. 

但分析并没有结束。你的数字 X 射线图像的好处不仅仅是你。想象一下，一个巨大的数字 X 射线图像集合，所有都标有诊断。我们可能使用计算机来搜索它们，并让机器学习寻找什么。而这些系统，由于零边际成本的魔力，最终可以免费提供未来的诊断。这正是我们希望发生的，但我们多快能达到这个目标，以及谁能控制结果，将取决于谁能获得数字 X 光图像。

If we made all healthcare information public, we would dramatically accelerate innovation in diagnosing and treating diseases. At present, only well-funded pharma companies and a few university research projects are able to develop new medical insights and drugs, since only they have the money required to get sufficient numbers of patients to participate in research. Many scientists therefore wind up joining big pharma companies, so the results of their work are protected by patents. Even at universities, the research agenda tends to be tightly controlled, and access to information is seen as a competitive advantage. While I understand that we have a lot of work to do to create a world in which the sharing of health information is widely accepted and has limited downsides, this is what we should be aiming for. 

如果我们将所有的医疗信息公开，我们将大大加快诊断和治疗疾病的创新。目前，只有资金雄厚的制药公司和少数大学的研究项目能够开发新的医学见解和药物，因为只有他们有足够的资金来获得足够数量的病人参与研究。因此，许多科学家最终加入了大型制药公司，因此他们的工作成果受到专利保护。即使在大学，研究议程也往往被严格控制，获取信息被视为一种竞争优势。虽然我知道我们还有很多工作要做，以创造一个健康信息共享被广泛接受且弊端有限的世界，但这是我们应该追求的目标。

You might wonder why I keep asserting that assuring privacy is impossible. After all, don’t we have encryption? Well, there are several problems that encryption can’t solve. The first is that the cryptographic keys used for encryption and decryption are just digital information themselves, so keeping them secure is another instance of the original problem. Even generating a key on your own machine offers limited protection, unless you are willing to risk that the data you’re protecting will be lost forever if you lose the key. As a result, most systems include some kind of cloud-based backup, making it possible that someone will access your data, either through technical interception or by tricking a human being to unwittingly participate in a security breach. If you want a sense of how hard this problem is, consider the millions of dollars in cryptocurrency that can no longer be accessed by people who lost their key or who had them taken over through some form of attack. The few cryptocurrency exchanges that have a decent track record have invested massively in security procedures, personnel screening and operational secrecy. 

你可能想知道为什么我一直断言保证隐私是不可能的。毕竟，我们不是有加密技术吗？嗯，有几个问题是加密无法解决的。首先是用于加密和解密的密码钥匙本身就是数字信息，所以保持它们的安全是原始问题的另一个实例。即使在你自己的机器上生成一个密钥，也只能提供有限的保护，除非你愿意冒风险，如果你丢失了密钥，你所保护的数据将永远丢失。因此，大多数系统包括某种基于云的备份，使得有人有可能访问你的数据，无论是通过技术拦截还是通过欺骗人类不知不觉地参与到安全漏洞中。如果你想了解这个问题有多难，请考虑一下数百万美元的加密货币，这些货币已经无法被丢失密钥或通过某种形式的攻击被接管的人所访问。少数有良好记录的加密货币交易所已经在安全程序、人员筛选和操作保密方面进行了大量投资。

The second problem is known as ‘endpoint security’. The doctor you’re sending your X-ray to for a second opinion might have a program on their computer that can access anything shown on the screen. In order to view your X-ray, the doctor has to decrypt and display it, so this program will have access to the image. Avoiding such a scenario would require us to lock down all computing devices, but that would mean preventing end users from installing software on them. Furthermore, even a locked-down endpoint is still subject to the “analog hole”: someone could simply take a picture of the screen, which itself could then be shared. 

第二个问题被称为『端点安全』。你要把你的 X 光片寄给第二个意见的医生，他们的电脑上可能有一个程序，可以访问屏幕上显示的任何东西。为了查看你的 X 射线，医生必须解密并显示它，因此这个程序将可以访问图像。要避免这样的情况，就需要我们锁定所有的计算设备，但这就意味着要阻止终端用户在上面安装软件。此外，即使是被锁定的终端仍然受到『模拟漏洞』的影响：有人可以简单地拍下屏幕的照片，然后它本身就可以被分享。

Locked-down computing devices reduce informational freedom and constrict innovation, but they also pose a huge threat to the knowledge loop and democracy. Handing over control of what you can compute and who you can exchange information with would essentially amount to submitting to a dictatorial system. In mobile computation we’re already heading in this direction, partly on the pretext of a need to protect privacy. Apple uses this as an argument to explain why the only way to install apps on an iPhone is through the App Store, which they control. Imagine this type of regime extended to all computing devices, including your laptop and cloud-based servers, and you have one way in which privacy is incompatible with technological progress. We can either have strong privacy assurance or open general-purpose computing, but we can’t have both. 

锁定的计算设备减少了信息自由并限制了创新，但它们也对知识圈和民主构成了巨大的威胁。交出对你可以计算的内容以及你可以与谁交换信息的控制权，本质上相当于服从于一个独裁的系统。在移动计算中，我们已经在朝这个方向发展，部分是以保护隐私的需要为借口。苹果公司用这个理由来解释为什么在 iPhone 上安装应用程序的唯一途径是通过他们控制的 App Store。想象一下这种制度扩展到所有计算设备，包括你的笔记本电脑和基于云的服务器，你就会发现隐私与技术进步不相容的一种方式。我们既可以拥有强大的隐私保障，也可以拥有开放的通用计算，但我们不可能两者兼得。

Many people contend that there must be some way to preserve privacy and keep innovating, but I challenge anyone to present a coherent vision of the future where individuals control technology and privacy is meaningfully protected. Whenever you leave your house, you might be filmed, since every smartphone has a camera, and in the future we’ll see tiny cameras on tiny drones. Your gait identifies you almost as uniquely as your fingerprint, your face is probably somewhere on the Internet, and your car’s license plate is readable by any camera. You leave your DNA almost everywhere you go, and we will soon be able to sequence DNA at home for around $100. Should the government control all of these technologies? And if so, should penalties be enforced for using them to analyze someone else’s presence or movement? Many are tempted to reply yes to these questions, without thinking through the consequences of such legislation for innovation and for the relative power of the state versus citizens. For example, citizens recently used facial recognition technology to identify police officers who had removed IDs from their uniforms. Advocates of banning this technology are overly focused on surveillance and never seem to consider these kind of “sousveillance” use cases (from French “sous” which means below).

许多人争辩说，必须有一些方法来保护隐私和继续创新，但我挑战任何人提出一个连贯的未来愿景，在那里个人控制技术和隐私得到有意义的保护。每当你离开家时，你可能会被拍摄，因为每个智能手机都有一个摄像头，在未来，我们会看到小型无人机上的微型摄像头。你的步态几乎和你的指纹一样独特地识别你，你的脸可能在互联网上的某个地方，而你的车牌可以被任何相机读取。你几乎走到哪里都会留下你的 DNA，而且我们很快就能在家里花 100 美元左右进行 DNA 排序。政府应该控制所有这些技术吗？如果是这样，是否应该对使用这些技术来分析别人的存在或行动进行处罚？许多人很想对这些问题回答『是』，却没有考虑到这种立法对创新和国家对公民的相对权力的影响。例如，公民最近使用面部识别技术来识别那些从制服上取下身份证的警察。主张禁止这种技术的人过度关注监视，似乎从未考虑过这种 *sousveillance* 的使用情况（来自法语 *sous*，意思是下面）。

There is an even more profound reason why privacy is incompatible with technological progress. Entropy is a fundamental property of the universe, which means it is easier to destroy than to create. It can take hours to build a sand castle that is destroyed by a single wave washing ashore. It takes two decades of care for a human to grow up and a single bullet to end their life. Because of this inherent asymmetry, technological progress increases our ability to destroy more quickly than our ability to create. Today, it still takes twenty years for a human to grow, and yet modern weapons can kill thousands and even millions of people in an instant. So as we make technological progress, we must eventually insist on less privacy in order to protect society. Imagine a future in which anyone can create a biological weapon in their basement laboratory—for example, an even more deadly version of the COVID-19 virus. After-the-crime law enforcement becomes meaningless in such a world.

还有一个更深刻的原因，即隐私与技术进步不相容。熵是宇宙的一个基本属性，这意味着破坏比创造更容易。建造一个沙堡可能需要几个小时，但被一个波浪冲上岸就毁了。一个人的成长需要 20 年的照顾，而一颗子弹就能结束他们的生命。由于这种固有的不对称性，技术进步使我们的破坏能力比我们的创造能力更快。今天，一个人的成长仍然需要 20 年，而现代武器却可以在瞬间杀死数千甚至数百万人。因此，随着我们的技术进步，我们最终必须坚持减少隐私，以保护社会。想象一下，在未来，任何人都可以在他们的地下室实验室里制造一种生物武器 —— 例如，一种更加致命的 COVID-19 病毒版本。在这样一个世界里，犯罪后的执法变得毫无意义。

If we can’t protect privacy without passing control of technology into the hands of a few, we should embrace a post-privacy world. We should work to protect people and their freedom, rather than data and privacy. We should allow more information to become public, while strengthening individual freedom. Much information is already disclosed through hacks and data breaches, and many people voluntarily share private information on blogs and social media (McCandless, 2020). The economic freedom generated by the introduction of UBI will play a key role here, because much of the fear of the disclosure of private information results from potential economic consequences. For instance, if you are worried that you might lose your job if your employer finds out that you wrote a blog post about your struggles with depression, you are much less likely to share, a situation that, repeated across many people, helps to keep the topic of depression a taboo. There are, of course, countries where the consequences of private information being leaked, such as sexual orientation or political organizing, can be deadly. To be able to achieve the kind of post-privacy world I envision here, democracy with humanist values is an essential precondition.

如果我们不能在不把技术控制权转到少数人手中的情况下保护隐私，我们应该接受一个后隐私世界。我们应该努力保护人和他们的自由，而不是数据和隐私。我们应该允许更多信息公开，同时加强个人自由。许多信息已经通过黑客和数据泄露被披露，许多人自愿在博客和社交媒体上分享私人信息（McCandless，2020）。引入 UBI 所产生的经济自由将在这里发挥关键作用，因为人们对私人信息披露的恐惧大多来自于潜在的经济后果。例如，如果你担心如果你的雇主发现你写了一篇关于你与抑郁症斗争的博文，你可能会失去工作，那么你就更不可能分享，这种情况在许多人身上重复出现，有助于使抑郁症的话题成为禁忌。当然，在有些国家，私人信息被泄露的后果，如性取向或政治组织，可能是致命的。为了能够实现我在这里设想的那种后隐私世界，具有人文主义价值观的民主是一个重要的前提条件。

If a post-privacy world seems impossible or terrifying, it is worth remembering that privacy is a modern, urban construct. Although the US Constitution protects certain specific rights, it does not recognize a generalized right to privacy. For thousands of years prior to the eighteenth century, most people had no concept directly corresponding to our modern notion of privacy. Many of the functions of everyday life used to take place much more openly than they do today. And privacy still varies greatly among cultures: for example, many Westerners are shocked when they first experience the openness of traditional Chinese public restrooms (Sasha, 2013). All over the world, people in small villages live with less privacy than is common in big cities. You can either regard the lack of privacy in village as oppressive, or you can see a close-knit community as a real benefit, for instance when your neighbor notices that you are sick because you haven’t left the house and offers to go shopping for you.

如果一个后隐私世界似乎是不可能的或可怕的，那么值得记住的是，隐私是一个现代的、城市的构造。尽管美国宪法保护某些特定的权利，但它并不承认普遍的隐私权。在十八世纪之前的几千年里，大多数人都没有直接对应于我们现代隐私概念的概念。日常生活中的许多功能曾经比今天更公开地进行。而且，不同文化之间的隐私仍有很大差异：例如，许多西方人第一次体验到中国传统公共厕所的开放性时，会感到震惊（Sasha，2013）。在世界各地，小村庄里的人生活的隐私比大城市里常见的要少。你可以把村子里缺乏隐私看作是一种压迫，也可以把紧密的社区看作是一种真正的好处，例如，当你的邻居注意到你因为没有离开家而生病，并主动为你去购物。

“But what about my bank account?” you might ask. “If my account number was public, wouldn’t it be easier for criminals to take my money?” This is why we need to construct systems such as Apple Pay and Android Pay that require additional authentication to authorize payments. Two-factor authentication systems will become much more common in the future, and we will increasingly rely on systems such as Sift, which assesses in real time the likelihood that a transaction is fraudulent. Finally, as the Bitcoin blockchain shows, it is possible to have a public ledger that anyone can inspect, as long as the transactions on it are protected by ‘private keys’ which allow only the owner of a Bitcoin address to initiate transactions. 

『但我的银行账户怎么办？』你可能会问。『如果我的账户号码是公开的，犯罪分子不是更容易拿走我的钱吗？』这就是为什么我们需要构建像苹果支付和安卓支付这样的系统，需要额外的认证来授权支付。双因素认证系统在未来将变得更加普遍，我们将越来越依赖 Sift 这样的系统，它可以实时评估一笔交易是欺诈性的可能性。最后，正如比特币区块链所显示的，只要其上的交易受到『私钥』的保护，只允许比特币地址的所有者发起交易，就有可能拥有一个任何人都可以检查的公共账本。

Another area where people are nervous about privacy is health information. We worry, for instance, that employers or insurers will discriminate against us if they learn that we have a certain disease or condition. Here the economic freedom conferred by UBI would help protect us from destitution because of discrimination. Furthermore by tightening the labor market, UBI would also make it harder for employers to refuse to hire certain groups of people in the first place. We could also enact laws that require transparency from employers to more easily detect discrimination (note that transparency is often difficult to require today because it conflicts with privacy). 

人们对隐私感到紧张的另一个领域是健康信息。例如，我们担心，如果雇主或保险公司得知我们有某种疾病或状况，会对我们进行歧视。在这里 ，UBI 所赋予的经济自由将有助于保护我们不会因为歧视而陷入贫困。此外，通过收紧劳动力市场 ，UBI 也将使雇主更难首先拒绝雇用某些群体。我们还可以制定法律，要求雇主提高透明度，以便更容易发现歧视（注意，今天要求透明度往往是困难的，因为它与隐私相冲突）。

Observers such as Christopher Poole, the founder of the online message board 4Chan, have worried that in the absence of privacy, individuals wouldn’t be able to engage online as freely. Privacy, they think, helps people feel comfortable assuming multiple online identities that may depart dramatically from their “real life” selves. I think, in contrast, that by keeping our online selves separate, we pay a price in the form of anxiety, neurosis and other psychological ailments. It is healthier to be transparent than to hide behind veils of privacy. Emotional health derives from the integration of our different interests into an authentic multi-dimensional personality, rather than a fragmentation of the self. This view is supported by studies of how online self-presentation impacts mental health, where inauthentic presentations were associated with higher levels of anxiety and neurosis (Twomey & O’Reilly, 2017). 

网上留言板 4Chan 的创始人克里斯托弗·普尔（Christopher Poole）等观察家担心，如果没有隐私，个人就无法在网上自由活动。他们认为，隐私有助于人们放心地承担多种网上身份，而这些身份可能与他们『现实生活』中的自己大相径庭。我认为，与此相反的是，通过保持网上自我的分离，我们付出了焦虑、神经衰弱和其他心理疾病的代价。透明比躲在隐私的面纱后面更健康。情感健康来自于将我们不同的兴趣整合成一个真实的多维人格，而不是自我的分裂。这一观点得到了关于网上自我介绍如何影响心理健康的研究的支持，不真实的介绍与较高的焦虑和神经症水平有关（Twomey & O'Reilly, 2017）。

Many who argue against a post-privacy approach point out that oppressive governments can use information against their citizens. Without a doubt, preserving democracy and the rule of law is essential if we want to achieve a high degree of informational freedom, and this is addressed explicitly in Part Five. Conversely, however, more public information makes dictatorial takeovers considerably harder. For instance, it is much clearer who is benefiting from political change if tax records are in the public domain.

许多反对后隐私方法的人指出，压迫性的政府可以利用信息来对付他们的公民。毫无疑问，如果我们想实现高度的信息自由，维护民主和法治是必不可少的，这一点将在第五部分明确讨论。然而，反过来说，更多的公共信息会使独裁者的接管变得更加困难。例如，如果税收记录在公共领域，那么谁从政治变革中获益就更清楚了。
