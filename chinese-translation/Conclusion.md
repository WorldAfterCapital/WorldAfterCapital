# Conclusion
# 结论

We need to act with great urgency during this transition to the Knowledge Age. We are woefully behind in dealing with the climate crisis, and there is a real possibility that as its consequences unfold, society will degenerate into violence. In the longer term, we face a potential threat from the possible rise of superintelligences, and there is also a chance that we are not alone in this universe. These are risks that we can only deal with if we stop clinging to the Industrial Age and instead embrace the Knowledge Age. Conversely, if we are able to make the transition, huge opportunities lie ahead of us.

在向知识时代过渡的过程中，我们需要采取非常紧急的行动。我们在应对气候危机方面落后得很厉害，而且随着其后果的展开，社会确实有可能堕落为暴力。从长远来看，我们面临着超级智能可能崛起的潜在威胁，而且还有可能在这个宇宙中我们并不孤单。这些风险，只有当我们不再依附于工业时代，而是拥抱知识时代时，我们才能应对。相反，如果我们能够实现过渡，巨大的机会就在我们面前。

## A Dangerous Spiral 
## 危险的螺旋 

The world is rapidly being pulled apart by people who want to take us back to the past, as well as people who are advancing technology while being trapped in Industrial Age thinking. As I described in the introduction, technology increases the space of the possible, but it does not automatically make everyone better off. Bound to an Industrial Age logic, automation is currently enriching a few, while putting pressure on large sections of society. Nor does digital publishing automatically accelerate the knowledge loop—we find ourselves in a world plagued by fake news and filter bubbles.

世界正在被一些人激烈地阻挠技术的推进和发展，包括那些想让我们回到过去的人，同时也包括被那些在工业时代思维中困住的人。正如我在导言中所描述的，技术增加了可能的空间，但它并不自动使每个人都过得更好。受限于工业时代的逻辑，自动化目前正在使少数人致富，而对社会的大部分人造成压力。数字出版也不会自动加速知识循环 —— 我们发现自己处在一个被假新闻和过滤泡沫困扰的世界。

Those who are trying to take us back into the past are exploiting these trends. They promise those negatively affected by technology that everything will be better, while investing heavily in mass manipulation. They seek to curtail the open Internet, while simultaneously building up secret surveillance. This is true on both sides of the American political spectrum. Neither the Republicans nor the Democrats have a truly forward-looking platform, and both favor governmental controls over online platforms and speech, instead of empowering end-users as described in the section on informational freedom.

那些试图把我们带回过去的人正在利用这些趋势。他们向那些受到技术负面影响的人承诺，一切都会好起来，同时大量投资于大规模的操纵行为。他们试图遏制开放的互联网，同时建立秘密监控。美国政治光谱的两边都是如此。共和党和民主党都都不具备真正的前瞻性，他们都赞成政府对网络平台和言论的控制，而不是像信息自由一节中描述的那样赋予终端用户权力。

The net effects of this are an increase in polarization and a breakdown of critical inquiry and democracy. As disturbing as it is, the possibility of large-scale violent conflict, both within and between nations, is increasing, while the climate crisis wreaks havoc on industrial and food supply chains around the world. At the same time, our ability to solve the problem of climate change is decreasing, because we are spiraling back towards the past directing our attention to nationalism. 

其净影响是两极分化的加剧和批判性调查与民主的崩溃。虽然令人不安，但在气候危机对世界各地的工业和食品供应链造成破坏的同时，国家内部和国家之间发生大规模暴力冲突的可能性正在增加。同时，我们解决气候变化问题的能力正在下降，因为我们正在螺旋式地回到过去，把注意力引向民族主义。

## Transhumans, Neohumans and Superintelligence 
## 超人类、新人类和超级智能

There’s another reason for urgency in navigating the transition to the Knowledge Age: we find ourselves on the threshold of creating both transhumans and neohumans. ‘Transhumans’ are humans with capabilities enhanced through both genetic modification (for example, via CRISPR gene editing) and digital augmentation (for example, the brain-machine interface Neuralink). ‘Neohumans’ are machines with artificial general intelligence. I’m including them both here, because both can be full-fledged participants in the knowledge loop.

在向知识时代过渡的过程中，还有一个紧迫的原因：我们发现自己正处在创造超人类和新人类的门槛上。『超人类』是指通过基因改造（例如，通过 CRISPR 基因编辑）和『数字增强』（例如，脑机接口 Neuralink）增强能力的人类。『新人类』是具有人工通用智能的机器。我在这里把它们都包括在内，因为它们都可以成为知识循环中的正式参与者。

Both transhumans and neohumans may eventually become a form of ‘superintelligence,’ and pose a threat to humanity. The philosopher Nick Bostrom published a book on the subject, and he and other thinkers warn that a superintelligence could have catastrophic results. Rather than rehashing their arguments here, I want to pursue a different line of inquiry: what would a future superintelligence learn about humanist values from our current behavior? 

超人类和新人类都可能最终成为一种『超级智能』，并对人类构成威胁。哲学家尼克·博斯特罗姆（Nick Bostrom）就这个问题出版了一本书，他和其他思想家警告说，超级智能可能会产生灾难性的结果。我不想在这里重提他们的论点，而是想追求一个不同的调查方向：未来的超级智能会从我们目前的行为中学习到什么人文主义价值观？

As we have seen, we’re not doing terribly well on the central humanist value of critical inquiry. We’re also not treating other species well, our biggest failing in this area being industrial meat production. Here as with many other problems that humans have created, I believe the best way forward is innovation. I’m excited about lab-grown meat and plant-based meat substitutes. Improving our treatment of other species is an important way in which we can use the attention freed up by automation. 

正如我们所看到的，我们在批判性探究这一人文主义核心价值方面做得并不出色。我们也没有很好地对待其他物种，我们在这个领域最大的失败是工业化肉类生产。就像人类造成的其他许多问题一样，我相信最好的办法是创新。我对实验室培育的肉类和基于植物的肉类替代品感到兴奋。改善我们对其他物种的待遇是一种重要的方式，我们可以利用自动化所释放的注意力。

Even more important, however, is our treatment of other humans. This has two components: how we treat each other now, and how we will treat the new humans when they arrive. As for how we treat each other now, we have a long way to go. Many of my proposals are aimed at freeing humans so they can discover and pursue their personal interests and purpose, while existing education and job loop systems stand in opposition to this freedom. In particular we need to construct the Knowledge Age in a way that allows us to overcome, rather than reinforce, our biological differences which have been used as justification for so much existing discrimination and mistreatment. That will be a crucial model for transhuman and neohuman superintelligences, as they will not have our biological constraints.

然而，更重要的是我们对其他人类的待遇。这有两个组成部分：我们现在如何对待对方，以及当新人类到来时我们将如何对待他们。至于我们现在如何对待对方，我们有很长的路要走。我的许多建议都是为了解放人类，使他们能够发现和追求他们的个人兴趣和目的，而现有的教育和劳务循环系统却与这种自由相对立。特别是我们需要以一种允许我们克服而不是加强我们的生物差异的方式来构建知识时代，这些差异被用作现有的许多歧视和虐待的理由。这将是超人类和新人类超级智能的一个重要模式，因为他们不会有我们的生物限制。

Finally, how will we treat the new humans? This is a difficult question to answer because it sounds so preposterous. Should machines have human rights? If they are humans, then they clearly should. My approach to what makes humans human—the ability to create and make use of knowledge—would also apply to artificial general intelligence. Does an artificial general intelligence need to have emotions in order to qualify? Does it require consciousness? These are difficult questions to answer but we need to tackle them urgently. Since these new humans will likely share little of our biological hardware, there is no reason to expect that their emotions or consciousness should be similar to ours. As we charge ahead, this is an important area for further work. We would not want to accidentally create a large class of new humans, not recognize them, and then mistreat them.

最后，我们将如何对待新人类？这是一个很难回答的问题，因为它听起来很荒唐。机器应该有人权吗？如果它们是人类，那么它们显然应该。我对人类之所以为人类的方法 —— 创造和利用知识的能力 —— 也将适用于人工通用智能。人工通用智能是否需要有情感才算合格？它是否需要有意识？这些都是难以回答的问题，但我们迫切需要解决这些问题。由于这些新人类很可能与我们的生物硬件没有什么共同之处，所以没有理由期望他们的情感或意识应该与我们相似。当我们向前冲时，这是一个需要进一步工作的重要领域。我们不希望意外地创造出一大类新人类，不承认他们，然后虐待他们。

## The Fermi Paradox and Alien Visitors 
## 费米悖论和外来访客 

I want to provide one final reason for urgency in getting to the Knowledge Age. It is easy for us to think of ourselves as the center of the universe. In early cosmology we put the Earth at the center, before we eventually figured out that we live on a small planet circling a star, in a galaxy that lies in an undistinguished location in an incomprehensibly large universe. More recently, we have discovered that the universe contains a great many planets more or less like ours, which means some form of intelligent life may have arisen elsewhere. This possibility leads to many fascinating questions, one of which is known as the Fermi paradox: if there is so much potential for intelligent life in the universe, why have we not yet picked up any signals?

我想为进入知识时代的紧迫性提供一个最后的理由。我们很容易认为自己是宇宙的中心。在早期的宇宙学中，我们把地球放在中心，然后我们最终发现，我们生活在一个小行星上，围绕着一颗恒星，在一个星系中，位于一个难以理解的大宇宙中的一个无名位置。最近，我们发现，宇宙中包含了大量或多或少与我们相似的行星，这意味着某种形式的智能生命可能已经在其他地方出现了。这种可能性导致了许多迷人的问题，其中一个问题被称为费米悖论：如果宇宙中存在如此多的智能生命的潜力，为什么我们还没有发现任何信号？

There are different possible answers to this question. For instance, perhaps civilizations get to a point similar to ours and then destroy themselves because they cannot make a crucial transition. Given the way we are handling our current transition, that seems like a distinct possibility. Maybe all intelligent civilizations encounter a problem that they cannot solve, such as the climate crisis, and either disappear entirely or suffer a collapse in knowledge and technology. Given the scale of cosmic time and space, short-lived broadcast civilizations like ours would be unlikely to be detected in any small spatiotemporal range. Furthermore, while climate change is a clear and present danger, there are also many other species-level challenges (Ord, 2021). 

对这个问题有不同的可能答案。例如，也许文明到了与我们相似的地步，然后因为不能进行关键的过渡而自我毁灭。鉴于我们处理当前过渡的方式，这似乎是一种明显的可能性。也许所有的智慧文明都遇到了它们无法解决的问题，比如气候危机，要么完全消失，要么遭遇知识和技术的崩溃。考虑到宇宙时间和空间的规模，像我们这样的短命广播文明将不太可能在任何小的时空范围内被发现。此外，虽然气候变化是一个明显的现实危险，但也有许多其他物种层面的挑战（Ord，2021）。

A different answer to the Fermi paradox would present a different challenge: more advanced civilizations may have gone dark so as to not be discovered and destroyed by even more advanced civilizations. By that account, we may be entering a particularly dangerous period, in which we have been broadcasting our presence but do not yet have the means to travel through space.

对费米悖论的不同回答会带来不同的挑战：更先进的文明可能已经变黑，以便不被更先进的文明发现和摧毁。按照这种说法，我们可能正在进入一个特别危险的时期，在这个时期，我们一直在广播我们的存在，但还没有办法在空间旅行。

## Opportunities in the Knowledge Age
## 知识时代的机遇

Conversely, it is worth asking what kind of opportunities we might explore in the Knowledge Age. To begin with, there is a massive opportunity for automation. Fifty years or so after a successful transition to the Knowledge Age, I expect the amount of attention trapped in the job loop to have shrunk to around 20 percent or less of all human attention. This is comparable to the shrinkage of attention focused on agriculture during the Industrial Age. We will finally be able to achieve the level of freedom that many thinkers had previously predicted, such as Keynes in his essay “The Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren,” where he wrote about humanity coming to enjoy a life of mostly leisure. Even Marx envisioned such a world, although he believed it would be brought about differently. He wrote about a system that “makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticize after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic.” That is the promise of the Knowledge Age.

相反，值得一问的是，我们可以在知识时代探索什么样的机会。首先，有一个巨大的自动化机会。在成功过渡到知识时代的 50 年左右，我预计被困在劳务循环中的注意力将缩减到所有人类注意力的 20% 左右或更少。这与工业时代专注于农业的注意力的缩减相当。我们将最终能够实现许多思想家之前预测的自由水平，例如凯恩斯在他的文章《我们孙子的经济可能性》中写道，人类将享受大部分休闲的生活。甚至马克思也设想了这样一个世界，尽管他认为它将以不同方式实现。他写到一个系统，『使我有可能今天做一件事，明天做另一件事，早上打猎，下午捕鱼，晚上养牛，晚饭后批评，就像我有思想一样，而不会成为猎人、渔夫、牧民或批评家。』这就是知识时代的承诺。

But there are many more opportunities for human progress, including space travel. One of the most depressing moments in my life came early on when I learned that at some point our sun will burn out and, in the process, annihilate all life on Earth. What is the point of anything we do if everything will come to an end anyhow? Thankfully I came to realize that with enough knowledge and progress, humanity could become a spacefaring species and live on other planets, before eventually traveling to the stars.

但是，人类还有许多进步的机会，包括太空旅行。我生命中最郁闷的时刻之一是在早期，我了解到在某个时刻我们的太阳会燃烧殆尽，在这个过程中，地球上的所有生命都会湮灭。如果一切都将结束，那么我们所做的一切又有什么意义呢？值得庆幸的是，我开始意识到，有了足够的知识和进步，人类可以成为一个航天物种，生活在其他星球上，最后再去星际旅行。

A third opportunity is the elimination of disease. It is sometimes easy to forget how far we have already come on that account. Many of the diseases that used to cripple or kill people have either become treatable or have been eliminated. We have started to make major progress in fighting cancer, and I believe there is a good chance that most cancers will become treatable within the next couple of decades. Ultimately this raises the question of mortality. Can, and should, we strive to become immortal? I believe we should, although achieving immortality will bring new problems. These are not the ones of overpopulation that some people imagine, as birth rates will be falling and there is, of course, space beyond our planet. The real challenge of immortality will be maintaining the functioning of the knowledge loop, as we will have to figure out not just how to keep the body alive but the mind flexible. Max Planck captured this challenge in his famous quote that “science advances one funeral at a time”—the older, dominant positions do not allow new theories to displace them.

第三个机会是消除疾病。有时很容易忘记我们在这方面已经取得了多大成就。许多曾经使人致残或致死的疾病，要么已经可以治疗，要么已经被消除了。我们已经开始在抗击癌症方面取得重大进展，而且我相信，在未来几十年内，大多数癌症都有可能变得可以治疗。归根结底，这提出了死亡率的问题。我们能否，以及是否应该努力成为不死之身？我相信我们应该，尽管实现永生会带来新的问题。这些问题不是一些人想象的人口过剩问题，因为出生率将下降，当然，我们的星球之外还有空间。长生不老的真正挑战将是维持知识循环的运作，因为我们不仅要弄清楚如何保持身体的活力，还要保持头脑的灵活性。马克斯·普朗克在他的名言中捕捉到了这一挑战，他说：『科学每次都在一个葬礼上进步』—— 旧的、主导的立场不允许新的理论取代它们。

A fourth opportunity is to go from capital being merely sufficient to capital being abundant. By the definitions set out earlier, that would mean that the marginal cost of capital was zero. The best way to imagine what that might look like is to think of the replicator from Star Trek. Imagine a microwave oven that instead of heating up a dish makes it from scratch, without requiring you to shop for the ingredients first. Such an abundance of capital might seem a preposterous idea that could never be achieved, but for most physical assembly processes today, the factors that limit the rate are the energy required and the need for humans to operate parts of the system. Machine learning is helping with the second factor, but progress on energy has been slow: we don’t yet have any fusion reactors that output more energy than is used to start the fusion, but there is no fundamental reason that can’t be achieved. With enough knowledge we will make nuclear fusion work, removing the second major barrier to the abundance of capital.

第四个机会是，从资本仅仅够用到资本充足。根据前面的定义，这将意味着资本的边际成本为零。想象这种情况的最好方法是想到《星际迷航》中的复制器。想象一下一个微波炉，它不是加热一道菜，而是从头开始做，不需要你先去买材料。如此丰富的资本可能看起来是一个永远无法实现的荒谬想法，但对于今天的大多数物理组装过程，限制速度的因素是所需的能源和需要人类来操作系统的部分。机器学习正在帮助解决第二个因素，但在能源方面的进展一直很缓慢：我们还没有任何核聚变反应堆输出的能量超过用于启动核聚变的能量，但没有根本原因不能实现。有了足够的知识，我们将使核聚变发挥作用，消除资本充裕的第二个主要障碍。

## The Challenge Ahead
## 未来的挑战

We live in a period where there is an extraordinary range of possible outcomes for humanity. They include the annihilation of humankind in a climate catastrophe, at one extreme, and the indefinite exploration of the universe, at the other. Where we end up depends on the large and small choices each of us makes every day, from how we treat another person in conversation to how we tackle the climate crisis. It is a massive challenge, and I wake up every day both scared and excited about this moment of transition. I sincerely hope that *The World After Capital* makes a small contribution to getting us to the Knowledge Age.

我们生活在一个对人类来说有一系列非凡的可能结果的时期。它们包括人类在一场气候灾难中被消灭，这是一个极端，而另一个极端则是对宇宙的无限探索。我们的结局取决于我们每个人每天所做的大大小小的选择，从我们在谈话中如何对待另一个人到我们如何解决气候危机。这是一个巨大的挑战，我每天醒来时对这个过渡时刻既害怕又兴奋。我真诚地希望《资本之后的世界》能够为我们进入知识时代做出一点贡献。
