# Growing Mindfulness
# 培养正念

One action we should all take is the development of a mindfulness practice. The word ‘mindfulness’ is used a lot and is easy to dismiss, but for the reasons discussed in the section on psychological freedom, without such a practice it will be difficult to participate fully in the other actions discussed below. We each need to find out what works for us, whether it’s meditation, yoga, running or something else entirely. I do a conscious breathing exercise every day, first thing in the morning and last thing in the evening. I started doing this about five years ago and the change in my life has been profound.

我们都应该采取的一个行动是发展正念（*mindfulness*）的练习。『正念』这个词用得很多，而且很容易被忽视，但由于心理自由一节中讨论的原因，如果没有这样的练习，就很难充分参与下面讨论的其他行动。我们每个人都需要找出适合自己的方法，无论是冥想、瑜伽、跑步还是其他完全不同的东西。我每天都做有意识的呼吸练习，早上第一件事，晚上最后一件事。我大约在五年前开始这样做，我的生活发生了深刻的变化。

It is also important that we help and inspire other people to do the same. There have been discussions on whether or not math should be mandatory in school, but there has been no such debate around mindfulness. It is entirely possible to go through school and college or university without developing a practice of one’s own. Every one of us would be better off with more mindfulness—the same cannot be said about algebra.

同样重要的是，我们要帮助和激励其他人也这样做。人们一直在讨论数学是否应该成为学校的必修课，但围绕正念却没有这样的辩论。通过学校和学院或大学而不发展自己的练习是完全可能的。我们每个人都会因为有更多的心智而变得更好 —— 这一点在代数方面不能说。

Another way to contribute to the spread of mindfulness is through research and entrepreneurship. Much remains to be understood about how different techniques, or drugs such as psilocybin, influence our brains. There is plenty of room for services such as individualized coaching, and for more apps that help with meditation and conscious breathing.

另一种促进正念传播的方式是通过研究和创业。关于不同的技术或药物（如迷幻药）如何影响我们的大脑，还有很多东西有待了解。个人化辅导等服务，以及更多帮助冥想和有意识呼吸的应用程序，都有很大的空间。
