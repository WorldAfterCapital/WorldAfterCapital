Even if you’re now convinced of the importance of the knowledge loop and attention scarcity in the digital age, and persuaded by my suggestions for increasing economic, informational and psychological freedom, that still leaves a huge question: can it be done?

即使你现在确信知识循环和注意力稀缺在数字时代的重要性，并被我关于增加经济、信息和心理自由的建议所说服，这仍然留下一个巨大的问题：它能做到吗？

You may think my proposals to change everything from how money is created to who controls computation are too extreme. You may dismiss them as utopian and argue that we cannot change everything about how we live. And yet to do so ignores the fact that we have already changed everything twice. Each of our two prior shifts in scarcity—from food in the Forager Age to land in the Agrarian Age, and from land to capital in the Industrial Age—was accompanied by extraordinary transformations. 

你可能认为我提出的改变一切的建议，从金钱的创造方式到谁控制计算，都过于极端。你可能认为这些建议是乌托邦式的，认为我们不可能改变我们生活的一切。然而，这样做忽略了一个事实，即我们已经两次改变了一切。我们之前的两次稀缺性转变 —— 从觅食时代的食物到农业时代的土地，以及从土地到工业时代的资本 —— 都伴随着非凡的转变。

When we transitioned from the Forager Age to the Agrarian Age, we went from nomadic to sedentary, from egalitarian to hierarchical, from promiscuous to monogamous and from animistic to theistic religions. When we went from the Agrarian Age to the Industrial Age, we moved from the countryside to cities, from large extended families to nuclear ones, from commons to private property, and from great-chain-of-being theologies to the Protestant work ethic. Though the first of these transitions took place over millennia and the second one over centuries, they still show that a shift in the binding scarcity comes with profound changes in how we live. 

当我们从觅食时代过渡到农业时代时，我们从游牧到定居，从平均主义到等级制度，从滥交到一夫一妻，从泛灵论到有神论宗教。当我们从农业时代进入工业时代时，我们从农村进入城市，从大家庭进入核心家庭，从公有财产进入私有财产，从大生命链神学进入新教工作伦理。尽管这些转变中的第一个发生在几千年前，第二个发生在几个世纪前，但它们仍然表明，约束性稀缺性的转变伴随着我们生活方式的深刻变化。

With scarcity shifting once more, from capital to attention, we will again have to change everything—no matter how daunting that may seem. What follows is a series of ideas for how each of us can contribute to that change. There are many different projects to be tackled—my list is far from exhaustive, and should be regarded as inspiration for how we can take responsibility.

随着稀缺性再次从资本转向注意力，我们将再次不得不改变一切 —— 无论这看起来多么令人畏惧。下面是一系列关于我们每个人如何为这种变化做出贡献的想法。有许多不同的项目需要解决 —— 我的清单远非详尽无遗，应该被视为对我们如何承担责任的启发。
