# 改善学习

Learning is the hardest step in the knowledge loop. How many of us say something like “I wish I could play the guitar,” but either never do anything about it or give up after a short period? Learning is hard, and we should try to make it easier, more fun and more social. There has been plenty of recent progress here: for example, Duolingo has made language learning more accessible by breaking it down into small units that are customized to each learner.

学习是知识循环中最难的一步。我们有多少人说过这样的话：『我希望我能弹吉他』，但要么从未做任何事情，要么在很短的时间内就放弃了？学习是困难的，我们应该努力使它更容易、更有趣、更社会化。最近在这方面有很多进展：例如 ，Duolingo 通过将语言学习分解成小单元，为每个学习者量身定做，使语言学习更容易。

I am personally excited about helping to create two particular projects. One is an integrated platform for learning math, programming, engineering and science. These areas of knowledge are closely related, yet the way we teach them is often oddly disconnected. The other project is a compendium of the principles of knowledge. We have so much knowledge that it seems impossible to know more than a tiny fraction of it all, but this is partly an illusion because much of it is a variation or an application of a much smaller set of underlying principles. Collecting and explaining these will make knowledge more accessible and help to unify areas that seem unrelated.

我个人对帮助创建两个特殊项目感到兴奋。一个是用于学习数学、编程、工程和科学的综合平台。这些知识领域是密切相关的，但我们教授它们的方式往往是奇怪的脱节的。另一个项目是一个知识原理的汇编。我们有如此多的知识，似乎不可能知道其中的一小部分，但这部分是一种错觉，因为大部分知识是一套更小的基本原则的变化或应用。收集和解释这些原则将使知识更容易获得，并有助于统一那些看起来不相关的领域。

While the COVID-19 crisis has come at a terrible cost, it has also accelerated innovation in learning. Many parents are discovering that home schooling their children, whether individually or in small groups, may be a viable option. There are many ways to encourage learning that is based on fostering our innate curiosity, from simply learning something new oneself to inventing and building new systems.

虽然 COVID-19 危机带来了可怕的代价，但它也加速了学习的创新。许多家长发现，让孩子在家里上学，无论是个人还是小组，都可能是一个可行的选择。有许多方法可以鼓励基于培养我们天生的好奇心的学习，从简单的自己学习新东西到发明和建立新系统。
