# Fighting the Climate Crisis
# 与气候危机作斗争

The climate crisis is the single biggest collective problem facing humanity. If we fail to direct attention and resources to fighting it, the climate crisis will make the transition from the Industrial Age worse than the transition into it, which involved two world wars. This may sound hyperbolic, but the climate crisis represents an existential risk for humanity.

气候危机是人类面临的唯一最大的集体问题。如果我们不能将注意力和资源用于对抗它，气候危机将使从工业时代的过渡比进入工业时代的过渡更糟糕，后者涉及两次世界大战。这可能听起来很夸张，但气候危机代表了人类的生存风险。

Every day, unimaginable amounts of energy hit the Earth in the form of sunlight. Much of this energy is radiated back into space, but greenhouse gases reduce the Earth’s ability to shed heat and instead keep it trapped inside the atmosphere. To get a sense of how much heat we are talking about, we can express it in terms of Hiroshima-sized nuclear bombs. Compared to pre-industrial times, how much more heat would you guess the Earth is retaining? The equivalent of one nuclear bomb per year? Per month? Per week? Per day? The reality is that the extra heat being trapped amounts to four nuclear bombs per second, of every minute, of every hour, of every day, three hundred and sixty-five days a year.

每天，难以想象的大量能量以阳光的形式照射到地球上。这些能量大部分被辐射回太空，但是温室气体降低了地球散发热量的能力，反而使其被困在大气层中。为了了解我们正在谈论的热量是多少，我们可以用广岛大小的核弹来表示。与工业化前的时代相比，你猜地球保留了多少热量？相当于每年一颗核弹？每个月？每星期？每一天？现实情况是，被截留的额外热量相当于每秒四颗核弹，每分钟、每小时、每一天，一年三百六十五天。

Imagine for a moment that alien spaceships were dropping four nuclear bombs into our atmosphere every second. What would we do? We would drop everything else to fight them. This is, of course, roughly the plot of the movie Independence Day. Except with the climate crisis it’s not aliens, it’s ourselves, and it’s not bright explosions, it’s all the molecules in the atmosphere and in the oceans wiggling a bit harder (that’s what it means for something to heat up).

想象一下，如果外星飞船每秒钟向我们的大气层投下四颗核弹。我们会怎么做？我们会放下其他一切来对抗它们。当然，这大概就是电影《独立日》的情节。只是在气候危机中，不是外星人，而是我们自己，也不是明亮的爆炸，而是大气和海洋中的所有分子都在用力扭动（这就是东西升温的意思）。

There are many ways to fight the climate crisis. They include making personal changes such as switching to electric heating, voting for politicians who are committed to tackling the problem, and becoming active in movements such as Extinction Rebellion. As with mindfulness, research and entrepreneurship provide crucial avenues for action. For instance, there are many questions in how to make nuclear fusion work (which would provide a clean source of abundant electricity) or how to most effectively draw down greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. There are companies to be founded that will further the adoption of solar power, not just here in the U.S. but in the developing world.

有许多方法可以对抗气候危机。它们包括做出个人改变，如改用电暖气，投票给那些致力于解决这个问题的政治家，并积极参加诸如 "灭绝叛乱 "等运动。与正念一样，研究和企业家精神为行动提供了关键的途径。例如，在如何使核聚变工作（这将提供丰富的清洁电力来源）或如何最有效地从大气中吸取温室气体方面，存在着许多问题。有一些公司的成立将进一步推动太阳能的采用，不仅是在美国，而且在发展中国家。
