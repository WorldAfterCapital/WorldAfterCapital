I will now provide a highly abstract account of human history that focuses on how technology has shifted scarcity over time and how those shifts have contributed to dramatic changes in human societies.

现在我将对人类历史进行高度抽象的描述，重点是技术如何随着时间的推移而转移稀缺性，以及这些转移如何促成了人类社会的巨大变化。

Homo sapiens emerged roughly two hundred and fifty thousand years ago. Over most of the time since, humans were foragers (also referred to as hunter-gatherers). During the Forager Age, the defining scarcity was food. Tribes either found enough food in their territory, migrated further or starved.

智人大约是在二十五万年前出现的。在此后的大部分时间里，人类都是觅食者（也被称为狩猎·采集者）。在觅食时代，决定性的稀缺是食物。部落要么在他们的领土上找到足够的食物，要么进一步迁移，要么饿死。

Then, roughly ten thousand years ago, humanity came up with a series of technologies such as the planting of seeds, irrigation and the domestication of animals that together we recognize today as agriculture. These technologies shifted the scarcity from food to land in what became the Agrarian Age. A society that had enough arable land (on which food can be grown), could meet its needs and flourish. It could, in fact, create a food surplus that allowed for the existence of groups such as artists and soldiers that were not directly involved in food production.

然后，大约一万年前，人类想出了一系列技术，如播种、灌溉和驯化动物，我们今天一起承认为农业。这些技术将食物的稀缺性转移到土地上，成为农业时代。一个社会如果有足够的可耕地（可以种植食物），就可以满足其需求并繁荣发展。事实上，它可以创造粮食盈余，使艺术家和士兵等不直接参与粮食生产的群体得以存在。

More recently, beginning about four hundred years ago with the Enlightenment, humanity invented a new series of technologies, including steam power, mechanical machines, chemistry, mining, and eventually technologies to produce, transmit and harness electricity. Collectively we refer to these today as the Industrial Revolution, and the age that followed as the Industrial Age. Once again, the scarcity shifted, this time away from food and towards capital, such as buildings, machinery and roads. Capital was scarce because we couldn’t meet the needs of a growing human population, including the need for calories, without building agricultural machines, producing fertilizer and constructing housing.

最近，从大约四百年前的启蒙运动开始，人类发明了一系列新技术，包括蒸汽动力、机械、化学、采矿，以及最终生产、传输和利用电力的技术。今天我们把这些统称为工业革命，把随后的时代称为工业时代。稀缺性再次发生变化，这一次从食物转向资本，如建筑、机械和道路。资本是稀缺的，因为如果不建造农业机械、生产肥料和建造住房，我们就无法满足不断增长的人类人口的需求，包括对卡路里的需求。

In each of those two prior transitions, the way humanity lived changed radically. In the transition from the Forager Age to the Agrarian Age we went from being nomadic to sedentary, from flat tribal societies to extremely hierarchical feudal societies, from promiscuity to monogamy (sort of), and from animistic religions to theistic ones. In the transition from the Agrarian Age to the Industrial Age we went from living in the country to living in the city, from large extended families to nuclear families or no family at all, from commons to private property (including private intellectual property) and from great-chain-of-being theologies to the Protestant work ethic.

在之前的两次过渡中，人类的生活方式都发生了根本性的变化。在从觅食时代到农业时代的过渡中，我们从游牧到定居，从扁平的部落社会到等级森严的封建社会，从滥交到一夫一妻制（某种程度上），以及从泛灵论宗教到有神论宗教。在从农业时代到工业时代的过渡中，我们从居住在乡村到居住在城市，从大家庭到核心家庭或根本没有家庭，从公有财产到私有财产（包括私人知识产权），从伟大的生命链神学到新教的工作伦理。

What accounts for these changes? In each transition the nature of the scarcity changed in a way that made measurement of human effort more difficult, which in turn required more sophisticated ways of providing incentives to sustain the necessary level of effort.

是什么原因导致了这些变化？在每一次转型中，稀缺性的性质都发生了变化，使得对人类努力的衡量更加困难，这反过来又需要更复杂的方法来提供激励以维持必要的努力水平。

In the Forager Age, when the key scarcity was food, the measurement and incentive problem was almost trivial: everyone in a tribe sees how much food the hunters and gatherers bring back, and it is either enough to feed everyone or not. In so-called immediate return societies (which had no storage) that is literally all there is to it. With storage the story gets slightly more complicated, but not by much. I believe that this explains many of the features of successful foraging tribal societies, including the flat hierarchy and the equality of sharing.

在觅食者时代，当关键的稀缺物是食物时，衡量和激励问题几乎是微不足道的：部落里的每个人都能看到猎手和采集者带回多少食物，这些食物要么足够养活所有人，要么不够。在所谓的立即返回社会（没有储存）中，这简直就是所有的问题了。有了储存，故事就会变得稍微复杂一些，但不会太复杂。我相信这可以解释成功的觅食部落社会的许多特征，包括扁平的等级制度和平等的分享。

In the Agrarian Age, when the scarcity was land, the measurement problem got significantly harder: you can really only tell at harvest time (once per year in many regions of the world) how well-off a society will be. Again, I believe that this explains many of the features of successful agrarian societies, in particular the need for a lot of structure and strict rules. It is crucial to keep in mind that these societies were essentially pre-scientific, so they had to find out what works by trial and error. When they found a rule that seemed to work, they wanted to stick with it and codify it (much of this happened via the theistic religions).

在农业时代，当稀缺的是土地时，测量问题变得明显困难：你真的只能在收获季节（在世界许多地区每年一次）知道一个社会将有多富裕。我再次相信，这解释了成功的农业社会的许多特征，特别是对大量结构和严格规则的需求。关键是要记住，这些社会基本上是前科学社会，所以他们不得不通过试验和错误来发现什么是可行的。当他们发现一个似乎有效的规则时，他们想坚持下去并将其编纂成法典（这在很大程度上是通过有神论宗教发生的）。

In the Industrial Age, when the scarcity was capital, the measurement problem became even harder. How do you decide where a factory should be built and what it should produce? It might take years of process and product innovation to put physical capital together that is truly productive. I believe that this explains much of the success of the market-based model, especially when contrasted with planned economies. Effectively, the solution to the incentive problem moved from static rules to a dynamic process that allows for many experiments to take place and only a few of them to succeed.

在工业时代，当稀缺的是资本时，测量问题变得更加困难。你如何决定一个工厂应该建在哪里以及它应该生产什么？可能需要多年的工艺和产品创新，才能把真正具有生产力的物质资本放在一起。我相信这在很大程度上解释了基于市场的模式的成功，尤其是在与计划经济的对比中。有效地，激励问题的解决方案从静态规则转为动态过程，允许进行许多实验，而只有少数实验能够成功。

These changes in how humanity lives were responses to an increasingly difficult measurement problem, as technological progress shifted scarcity from food to land and then from land to capital. But the transitions don’t occur deterministically; they are the result of human choice driving changes in regulation. For example, when it came to the scarcity of capital, humanity tried out radically different approaches between market-based and planned economies. As it turned out, competitive markets, combined with entrepreneurialism and the strategic deployment of state support (e.g. in the form of regulation), were better at allocating and accumulating capital. Similarly, the Agrarian Age contained vastly different societies, including the Athenian democracy, which was hugely advanced compared to much of Northern European society in the Middle Ages.

人类生活方式的这些变化是对日益困难的测量问题的回应，因为技术进步将稀缺性从食物转移到土地，然后从土地转移到资本。但这些转变并不是决定性地发生的；它们是人类选择推动监管变化的结果。例如，当涉及到资本的稀缺性时，人类在基于市场的经济和计划经济之间尝试了截然不同的方法。事实证明，竞争性市场，结合创业精神和国家支持的战略部署（如监管形式），更有利于分配和积累资本。同样，农业时代包含了巨大的不同社会，包括雅典的民主，与中世纪北欧的大部分社会相比，雅典的民主是非常先进的。

The other important point to note about the previous transitions is that they took quite some time and were incredibly violent. Agriculture emerged over the span of thousands of years, during which time agrarian societies slowly expanded, either subduing or killing foraging tribes. The transition from the Agrarian Age to the Industrial Age played out over several hundred years and involved many bloody revolutions and ultimately two world wars. At the end of the Agrarian Age, the ruling elites had gained their power from controlling land and still believed it to be the critical scarcity. For them, industry was a means of building and equipping increasingly powerful armies with tanks and battleships to ensure control over land. Even the Second World War was about land, as Hitler pursued “Lebensraum“ (literally “room to live”) for his Third Reich. It was only after the Second World War that we finally left the Agrarian Age behind for good.

关于以前的过渡，需要注意的另一点是，它们花了相当长的时间，而且是令人难以置信的暴力。农业的出现历时数千年，在此期间，农业社会慢慢扩张，要么征服，要么杀死觅食部落。从农业时代到工业时代的过渡经历了几百年的时间，涉及许多血腥的革命和最终的两次世界大战。在农业时代结束时，统治精英们通过控制土地获得了权力，并且仍然认为土地是关键的稀缺品。对他们来说，工业是建立和装备越来越强大的军队的一种手段，用坦克和战舰来确保对土地的控制。甚至第二次世界大战也与土地有关，因为希特勒为他的第三帝国追求 *Lebensraum*（字面意思是『生活的空间』）。只是在第二次世界大战之后，我们才最终永远地离开了农业时代。

We now, once again, find ourselves in a transition period, because digital technology is shifting the scarcity from capital to attention. What should be clear by now is that this transition will also require dramatic changes in how humanity lives, just as the two prior transitions did. It is also likely that the transition will play itself out over several generations, instead of being accomplished quickly.

我们现在再次发现自己处于一个过渡时期，因为数字技术正在将稀缺性从资本转移到注意力。现在应该很清楚的是，这种过渡也需要人类生活方式的巨大变化，就像之前的两次过渡一样。同时，这一过渡也可能会在几代人的时间内完成，而不是迅速完成。

Finally, there is a historic similarity to the transition out of the Agrarian Age that explains why many governments have been focused on incremental changes. To understand, we should first note that capital today is frequently thought of as monetary wealth or financial capital, even though it is productive capital (machines, buildings and infrastructure) that really matters. Financial capital allows for the formation of physical capital, but it does not directly add to the production of goods and services. Companies only require financial capital because they have to pay for machines, supplies and labor before they receive payment for the product or service they provide. 

最后，与走出农业时代的过渡有一个历史性的相似之处，解释了为什么许多政府一直专注于渐进式变革。为了理解，我们首先应该注意，今天的资本经常被认为是货币财富或金融资本，尽管真正重要的是生产性资本（机器、建筑和基础设施）。金融资本允许物质资本的形成，但它并不直接增加商品和服务的生产。公司只需要金融资本，因为他们必须在为他们提供的产品或服务收到付款之前支付机器、用品和劳动力。

Just as the ruling elites at the end of the Agrarian Age came from land, the ruling elites today come from capital. They often don’t take up political roles themselves but rather have ways of influencing policy indirectly, exposing them to less personal risk. A good recent example is the role of the billionaire hedge fund manager Robert Mercer and his family in supporting groups that influenced the outcome of the US Presidential election in 2016, such as the right-wing news organization Breitbart (Gold, 2017).

正如农业时代末期的统治精英来自于土地，今天的统治精英来自于资本。他们往往不亲自担任政治角色，而是有办法间接地影响政策，使他们面临较少的个人风险。最近的一个很好的例子是亿万富翁对冲基金经理罗伯特·默瑟及其家族在支持影响 2016 年美国总统选举结果的团体中所扮演的角色，比如右翼新闻组织布莱特巴特（Gold, 2017）。
