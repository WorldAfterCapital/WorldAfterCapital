# Choices
# 选择

Believing in the potential of progress does not mean being a Pollyanna, and it is important to remember that progress is not the inevitable result of technology. Contrary to the claims made by the technology writer Kevin Kelly in his book *What Technology Wants*, technology doesn’t want a better world for humanity; it simply makes such a world possible. 

相信进步的潜力并不意味着成为一个波利安娜，重要的是要记住，进步不是技术的必然结果。与技术作家凯文-凯利在其《技术想要什么》一书中的说法相反，技术并不希望人类有一个更好的世界；它只是让这样的世界成为可能。

Nor does economics ‘want’ anything: nothing in economic theory, for instance, says that a new technology cannot make people worse off. Economics gives us tools that we can use to analyze markets and design regulations to address their failures, but we still need to make choices relating to what we want markets and regulations to accomplish. 

经济学也没有『想要』什么：例如，经济理论中没有任何内容说一项新技术不能让人们的生活变得更糟。经济学为我们提供了工具，我们可以用来分析市场，并设计法规来解决市场的失败，但我们仍然需要对我们希望市场和法规实现的目标做出选择。

Moreover, contrary to what Karl Marx thought, history also doesn’t ‘want’ anything. There isn’t a deterministic mechanism through which conflicts between labor and capital are ultimately bound to be resolved in favor of a classless society. Nor is there, as the political economist Francis Fukuyama would have it, an “end of history“—a final social, economic and political system. History doesn’t make its own choices, it is the result of human choices, and there will be new choices to make, as long as we continue to make technological progress. 

此外，与卡尔·马克思的想法相反，历史也不『想要』什么。并不存在一个决定性的机制，通过这个机制，劳动和资本之间的冲突最终一定会以有利于无阶级社会的方式解决。也没有像政治经济学家弗朗西斯·福山（Francis Fukuyama）所说的那样，有一个『历史的终结』—— 存在一个最终的社会、经济和政治制度。历史不会做出自己的选择，它是人类选择的结果，而且只要我们继续取得技术进步，就会有新的选择。

It always has been our responsibility to make choices about which of the worlds made possible by new technology we want to live in. Some of these choices need to be made collectively (requiring rules or regulations), and some of them need to be made individually (requiring self-regulation). The choices we are faced with today are especially important because digital technology so dramatically increases the ‘space of the possible’ that it includes the potential for machines that possess knowledge and will eventually want to make choices of their own.

我们一直有责任对新技术所带来的世界中哪些是我们想要生活的做出选择。其中有些选择需要集体做出（需要规则或条例），有些则需要个人做出（需要自律）。我们今天面临的选择尤其重要，因为数字技术极大地增加了『可能空间』，它包括拥有知识的机器的潜力，并最终想要做出自己的选择。

## Regulation 
## 监管 

The people building or funding digital technology tend to be optimists and to believe in progress (though there are also opportunists thrown into the mix). Many of those optimists also believe in the need for regulation, while another group has a decidedly libertarian streak and would prefer governments not to be involved. For them, regulation and progress conflict. The debates between these two groups are often acrimonious, which is unfortunate, because the history of technology clearly demonstrates both the benefits of good regulation and the dangers of bad regulation. Our energy is thus better spent on figuring out the right kind of regulation, as well as engaging in the processes required to enforce and revise it.

建设或资助数字技术的人往往是乐观主义者，相信进步（尽管也有机会主义者加入其中）。这些乐观主义者中的许多人也相信需要监管，而另一个群体则有明显的自由主义倾向，希望政府不要介入。对他们来说，监管和进步是冲突的。这两类人之间的争论往往是激烈的，这很不幸，因为技术的历史清楚地表明了良好的监管的好处和不良监管的危险。因此，我们的精力最好花在找出正确的监管方式上，以及参与执行和修订监管所需的过程。

The history of regulating automotive technology is instructive here. Much of the world currently gets around by driving cars. The car was an important technological innovation because it vastly enhanced individual mobility, but its widespread adoption and large scale impacts would have been impossible without legislation, including massive public investments. We needed to build roads and to agree on how they should be used, neither of which could have been accomplished based solely on individual choices. Roads are an example of a ‘natural monopoly.’ Multiple disjointed road networks or different sets of rules would be hugely problematic: imagine what would happen if some people drove on the left side of the road and others drove on the right. Natural monopolies are situations where markets fail and regulation is required, and social norms are another form of regulation. The car would have been less widely adopted as a mode of individual transport without changes in social norms that made it acceptable for women to drive, for instance. 

监管汽车技术的历史在这里很有启发。目前世界上大部分人都是通过驾驶汽车出行的。汽车是一项重要的技术革新，因为它极大地提高了个人的流动性，但如果没有立法，包括大规模的公共投资，它的广泛采用和大规模的影响是不可能的。我们需要建造道路，并就如何使用这些道路达成一致，而这两点仅靠个人选择是不可能实现的。道路是一个『自然垄断』的例子。多个不连贯的道路网络或不同的规则将产生巨大的问题：想象一下，如果一些人在道路的左边开车，而另一些人在右边开车，会发生什么。自然垄断是市场失效和需要监管的情况，而社会规范是另一种形式的监管。例如，如果没有社会规范的改变，使妇女开车被接受，那么汽车作为一种个人交通方式就不会被广泛采用。

Not all regulation is good, of course. In fact, the earliest regulation of automotive vehicles was aimed at delaying their adoption by limiting them to walking speed. In the United Kingdom they were even required by law in their early years to be preceded by someone on foot carrying a red flag (“Red Flag Traffic Laws,” 2020). Similarly, not all regulation of digital technology will be beneficial. Much of it will initially aim to protect the status quo and to help established enterprises, including the new incumbents. The recent changes to net neutrality rules are a good example of this (Kang, 2017).

当然，并非所有的监管都是好的。事实上，最早对汽车的监管是为了延迟汽车的采用，将其限制在步行速度。在英国，早年的法律甚至要求它们必须由手持红旗的步行者先行（《红旗交通法》，2020）。同样地，并非所有的数字技术监管都是有益的。它的大部分最初都是为了保护现状，帮助已建立的企业，包括新的在位者。最近对网络中立性规则的修改就是一个很好的例子（Kang, 2017）。

My proposals for regulation, which I will present later in the book, are aimed at encouraging innovation by giving individuals more economic freedom and better access to information. These regulations, which are choices we need to make collectively, represent a big departure from the status quo and from the programs of the established parties here in the United States and in most other countries. They aim to let us explore the space of the possible that digital technologies have created, so we can transition from the Industrial Age to the Knowledge Age. 

 
## Self-Regulation 
## 自我监管 

Another set of choices has to do with how we react individually to the massive acceleration of information dissemination and knowledge creation that digital technology makes possible. These are not rules that society can impose, because they relate to our inner mental states: they are changes we need to make for ourselves. For instance, there are many people who feel so offended by content that they encounter on the Internet, from videos on YouTube to comments on Twitter, that they become filled with anxiety, rage, and other painful emotions leading them to withdraw or lash out, furthering polarization and cycles of conflict. Other people become trapped in ‘filter bubbles’ that disseminate algorithmically curated information that only confirms their existing biases, while others spend all their time refreshing their Instagram or Facebook feeds. Even though some regulation can help, as well as more technology, overcoming these problems will require us to change how we react to information.
 
另一组选择关系到我们如何对数字技术所带来的信息传播和知识创造的大规模加速做出个人反应。这些不是社会可以强加的规则，因为它们与我们内在的精神状态有关：它们是我们需要为自己做出的改变。例如，有许多人对他们在互联网上遇到的内容感到非常反感，从 YouTube 上的视频到 Twitter 上的评论，他们充满了焦虑、愤怒和其他痛苦的情绪，导致他们退缩或抨击，进一步加剧了两极化和冲突的循环。另一些人则被『过滤泡泡』（Filter bubbles）困住了，这些泡泡传播着经过算法处理的信息，而这些信息只能证实他们现有的偏见，还有一些人把所有时间都花在刷新他们的 Instagram 或 Facebook 信息上。即使一些监管可以帮助，以及更多的技术，克服这些问题将需要我们改变我们对信息的反应方式。

Changing our reactions is possible through self-regulation, by which I mean training that enhances our capacity to think critically. From Stoicism in ancient Greece to Eastern religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism, humans have a long tradition of practices designed to manage our immediate emotional responses, enabling us to react to the situations we experience in insightful and responsible ways. These mindfulness practices align with what we have learned more recently about the workings of the human brain and body. If we want to be able to take full advantage of digital technology, we need to figure out how to maintain our powers of critical thinking and creativity in the face of an onslaught of information including deliberate attempts to exploit our weaknesses.

改变我们的反应是可能的，通过自我监管，我指的是提高我们批判性思考能力的训练。从古希腊的斯多葛主义到东方宗教，如印度教和佛教，人类有着悠久的实践传统，旨在管理我们的直接情绪反应，使我们能够以有洞察力和负责任的方式对我们经历的情况做出反应。这些正念练习与我们最近学到的关于人类大脑和身体的工作原理相一致。如果我们希望能够充分利用数字技术，我们需要弄清楚如何在面对信息的冲击时保持我们的批判性思维和创造力，包括故意利用我们的弱点。
