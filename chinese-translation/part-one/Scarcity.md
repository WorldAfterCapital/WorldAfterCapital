# Scarcity
# 稀缺性

Those with some familiarity with economic theory are likely to understand ‘scarcity’ in its terms. In that context, something is scarce if its price is greater than zero. By this definition, land is scarce—it costs a lot of money to buy a piece of land. And financial capital is still because even with our current low interest rates, there is a price for borrowing money or raising equity.

那些对经济理论有一定了解的人可能会从其角度理解『稀缺性』。在这种情况下，如果某样东西的价格大于零，它就是稀缺的。根据这个定义，土地是稀缺的 —— 购买一块土地需要很多钱。而金融资本仍然是，因为即使我们目前的低利率，借钱或筹集股权也是有价格的。

However, there is a fundamental problem with this price-based definition of scarcity: anything can be made scarce by assigning ownership of it. Imagine for a moment that the world’s atmosphere belonged to Global Air Ltd, a company which could charge a fee to anyone who breathes air. Air would suddenly have become scarce, according to the price-based theory of scarcity. That might seem like an extreme example, and yet some people have argued that assigning ownership to the atmosphere would solve the problem of air pollution, on the grounds that it would result in the air’s owners having an economic incentive to maintain an unpolluted atmosphere. 

然而，这种基于价格的稀缺性定义有一个根本问题：任何东西都可以通过分配所有权而变得稀缺。想象一下，世界上的大气属于全球航空有限公司，这家公司可以向任何呼吸空气的人收取费用。根据基于价格的稀缺性理论，空气将突然变得稀缺。这似乎是一个极端的例子，但有些人认为，将所有权分配给大气层将解决空气污染的问题，理由是这将导致空气的所有者有经济动机来维持一个没有污染的大气层。

Here I will use a different meaning of scarcity, one not based on price. I will call something scarce when there is less of it than we require to meet our needs. If people are starving because not enough food has been produced (or made available), food is scarce. Insofar as more knowledge would allow this problem to be solved, this can be thought of as technological (as opposed to economic) scarcity. The point here is that technological progress makes things less scarce. As I discuss in Part Two below, the eighteenth-century scholar Thomas Malthus (1798) was correct when he predicted that global population growth would be exponential, but his prediction that such growth would outpace growth in the food supply, resulting in ongoing shortages and mass starvation, turned out to be wrong, because technological progress resulted in exponential increases in food production. In fact, recent advances in agricultural techniques have meant that the amount of land needed for food production is now declining, even as food production is continuing to grow rapidly. 

在这里，我将使用稀缺性的不同含义，一个不基于价格的含义。当某样东西的数量少于我们满足需求的数量时，我就称之为稀缺。如果人们因为没有生产（或提供）足够的食物而挨饿，食物就是稀缺的。只要更多的知识能使这个问题得到解决，这就可以被认为是技术（而不是经济）稀缺。这里的重点是，技术进步使事物不那么稀缺。正如我在下面第二部分所讨论的，十八世纪的学者托马斯-马尔萨斯（1798）在预测全球人口增长将是指数级的时候是正确的，但他关于这种增长将超过食物供应的增长，导致持续短缺和大规模饥饿的预测，结果是错误的，因为技术进步导致食物生产的指数级增长。事实上，最近农业技术的进步意味着粮食生产所需的土地数量现在正在减少，即使粮食生产在继续快速增长。

But is it possible to draw a clear distinction between needs and wants? If people are not starving but want more or different food, can food still be scarce? Modern economics equates the two, but intuitively we know that this is not the case. We need to drink water, but want to drink champagne. We need to provide our body with calories, but want to eat caviar. These examples are obviously extremes, but the point is that many different foods can be used to meet the need for calories. Desiring a particular food is a want, while getting enough calories (and other nutrients) is a need. In Part Two, I set out a list of the needs and look at our current and future ability to fulfill them.

但是否有可能明确区分需求和欲望？如果人们没有挨饿，但想要更多或不同的食物，那么食物还能是稀缺的吗？现代经济学将这两者等同起来，但凭直觉我们知道情况并非如此。我们需要喝水，但想喝香槟。我们需要为我们的身体提供热量，但却想吃鱼子酱。这些例子显然是极端的，但问题是，许多不同的食物可以用来满足对热量的需求。渴望某种特定的食物是一种需求，而获得足够的卡路里（和其他营养物质）则是一种需要。在第二部分中，我列出了一份需求清单，并考察了我们目前和未来满足这些需求的能力。

Importantly, if something is no longer scarce, it isn’t necessarily abundant—there is an intermediate stage, which I will call ‘sufficiency’. For instance, there is sufficient land on the planet to meet everyone’s needs, but building housing and growing food still requires significant physical resources, and hence these things are not abundant. I can foresee a time when technological progress makes land and food abundant—imagine how much space we would have if we could figure out how to live on other planets. Digital information is already on a clear path to abundance: we can make copies of it and distribute them at zero marginal cost, thus meeting the information needs of everyone connected to the Internet.

重要的是，如果某样东西不再稀缺，它不一定是丰富的--有一个中间阶段，我将称之为『充足』。例如，地球上有足够的土地来满足每个人的需求，但建造住房和种植食物仍然需要大量的物理资源，因此这些东西并不丰富。我可以预见，当技术进步使土地和食物变得丰富的时候 —— 想象一下，如果我们能够弄清楚如何在其他星球上生活，我们会有多少空间。数字信息已经走上了一条明确的丰裕之路：我们可以复制它，并以零边际成本分发，从而满足每个与互联网连接的人的信息需求。

With this needs-based definition of scarcity in place, we can now examine how technology has shifted the constraining scarcity for humanity over time.

有了这个基于需求的稀缺性定义，我们现在可以研究技术是如何随着时间的推移而改变对人类的制约性稀缺性的。
