# Humanism
# 人文主义

What are the values that I am basing all this on, and where do they come from? In his book *Sapiens*, the historian Yuval Noah Harari claims that all value systems are based on equally valid subjective narratives. He denies that there is an objective basis for humanism to support a privileged position for humanity as a species, but here I will try to convince you that he is wrong (Harari, 2011). For not only is the power of knowledge a source of optimism; its very existence provides the basis for humanism. By “humanism” I mean a system of values that centers on human agency and responsibility rather than on the divine or the supernatural, and that embraces the process of critical inquiry as the central enabler of progress.

我所依据的价值观是什么，它们来自哪里？历史学家尤瓦尔-诺亚-哈拉里（Yuval Noah Harari）在他的《智人》一书中声称，所有的价值体系都是基于同样有效的主观叙述。他否认人文主义有客观基础支持人类作为一个物种的特权地位，但在这里我将试图说服你，他是错误的（Harari, 2011）。因为知识的力量不仅是乐观主义的来源；它的存在本身就为人文主义提供了基础。我所说的『人文主义』是指一种价值观体系，它以人类的能动性和责任为中心，而不是以神性或超自然为中心，并将批判性探究的过程作为进步的核心推动力。

Knowledge, as I have already defined it, is the externalized information that allows humans to share insights with each other. It includes both scientific and artistic knowledge. Again, we are the only species on Earth that generates this kind of knowledge, with the ability to share it over space and time. I am able to read a book today that someone else wrote a long time ago and in a completely different part of the world.

知识，正如我已经定义的那样，是使人类能够相互分享见解的外化信息。它包括科学和艺术知识。同样，我们是地球上唯一产生这种知识的物种，有能力在空间和时间上分享它。我今天能够读到一本别人在很久以前写的书，而且是在世界一个完全不同的地方。

This matters a great deal, because knowledge enables fundamentally different modes of problem solving and progress. Humans can select and combine knowledge created by other humans, allowing small changes to accrete into large bodies of work over time, which in turn provide the basis for scientific and artistic breakthroughs. Without knowledge, other species have only two methods of sharing things they have learned: communication and evolution. Communication is local and ephemeral, and evolution is extremely slow. As a result, animals and plants routinely encounter problems that they cannot solve, resulting in disease, death and even extinction. Many of these problems today are caused by humans (more on that shortly).

这一点非常重要，因为知识使问题的解决和进步有了根本性的不同模式。人类可以选择和结合其他人类创造的知识，使小的变化随着时间的推移累积成大的作品，这反过来又为科学和艺术的突破提供了基础。如果没有知识，其他物种只有两种方法来分享他们学到的东西：交流和进化。沟通是局部的和短暂的，而进化是极其缓慢的。因此，动物和植物经常会遇到它们无法解决的问题，导致疾病、死亡甚至灭绝。今天的许多问题都是由人类造成的（稍后会有更多的介绍）。

Knowledge has given humanity great power. We can fly in the sky, we can sail the seas, travel fast on land, build large and durable structures, and so on. The power of our knowledge is reshaping the Earth. It often does so in ways that solve one set of problems while creating an entirely new set of problems, not just for humans but for other species. This is why it is crucial that we remember what the story of Spiderman tells us: “With great power comes great responsibility.” It is because of knowledge that humans are responsible for looking after dolphins, rather than the other way round. 

知识给了人类巨大的力量。我们可以在天上飞，我们可以在海上航行，在陆地上快速旅行，建造大型和耐用的结构，等等。我们知识的力量正在重新塑造地球。它经常以解决一组问题的方式进行，同时创造出一系列全新的问题，不仅是对人类，而且对其他物种。这就是为什么我们要记住蜘蛛侠的故事告诉我们的关键。『巨大的力量带来巨大的责任』。正是因为有了知识，人类才有责任照顾海豚，而不是反过来。

Progress and knowledge are inherently linked through critical inquiry: we can only make progress if we are capable of identifying some ideas as better than others. Critical inquiry is by no means linear—new ideas are not always better than old ones. Sometimes we go off in the wrong direction. Still, given enough time, a sorting takes place. For instance, we no longer believe in the geocentric view of our solar system, and only a tiny fraction of the art that has ever been created is still considered important. While this process may take decades or even centuries, it is blindingly fast compared to biological evolution. 

进步和知识通过批判性探究内在地联系在一起：只有当我们有能力确定一些想法比其他想法更好时，我们才能取得进步。批判性探究绝不是线性的 —— 新思想不一定比旧思想好。有时我们会在错误的方向上走下去。不过，只要有足够的时间，还是会发生排序。例如，我们不再相信太阳系的地心说，只有一小部分曾经创造过的艺术仍然被认为是重要的。虽然这个过程可能需要几十年甚至几个世纪，但与生物进化相比，它的速度是惊人的。

My use of the word “better” implies the existence of universal values. All of these flow from the recognition of the power of human knowledge and the responsibility which directly attaches to that power. And the central value is the process of critical inquiry itself. We must be vigilant in pointing out flaws in existing knowledge and proposing alternatives. After all, imagine how impoverished our music would be if we had banned all new compositions after Beethoven. 

我使用的『更好』一词意味着普遍价值的存在。所有这些都来自于对人类知识的力量和直接与这种力量相联系的责任的认识。而核心价值是批判性探究的过程本身。我们必须警惕地指出现有知识的缺陷并提出替代方案。毕竟，想象一下，如果我们禁止贝多芬之后的所有新作品，我们的音乐将是多么的贫乏。

We should thus seek regulation and self-regulation that supports critical inquiry, in the broad sense of processes that weed out bad ideas and help better ones to propagate. In business this often takes the form of market competition, which is why regulation that supports competitive markets is so important. Individually, critical inquiry requires us to be open to receiving feedback in the face of our deeply rooted tendency toward confirmation bias. In politics and government, critical inquiry is enabled by the democratic process. 

因此，我们应该寻求支持批判性探究的监管和自律，从广义上讲，就是剔除坏想法并帮助更好的想法传播的过程。在商业中，这往往采取市场竞争的形式，这就是为什么支持竞争性市场的监管如此重要。就个人而言，批判性探究要求我们在面对我们根深蒂固的确认偏见的倾向时，对接受反馈持开放态度。在政治和政府中，批判性调查是由民主进程促成的。

Freedom of speech is not a value in and of itself; rather, it is a crucial enabler of critical inquiry. But we can see how some limits on free speech might flow from the same value. If you can use speech to call for violence against individuals or minority groups, you can also use it to suppress critical inquiry. 

言论自由本身并不是一种价值；相反，它是批判性探究的重要助推器。但我们可以看到对言论自由的一些限制是如何从同一价值中产生的。如果你可以利用言论来呼吁对个人或少数群体的暴力，你也可以利用它来压制批判性的探索。

Digital technology, including a global information network and the general-purpose computing that is bringing machine intelligence, are dramatically accelerating the rate at which humanity can accumulate and share knowledge. However, these same technologies also allow targeted manipulation and propaganda on a global scale, as well as constant distraction, both of which undermine the evaluation and creation of knowledge. Digital technology thus massively increases the importance of critical inquiry, which is central to knowledge-based humanism. 

数字技术，包括全球信息网络和带来机器智能的通用计算，正在极大地加快人类积累和分享知识的速度。然而，这些技术也允许在全球范围内进行有针对性的操纵和宣传，以及不断地分散注意力，这两者都破坏了知识的评估和创造。因此，数字技术极大地增加了批判性探究的重要性，而批判性探究是以知识为基础的人文主义的核心。

Beyond critical inquiry, optimism and responsibility, other humanist values are also rooted in the existence of knowledge. One of these is solidarity. There are nearly 8 billion human beings living on Earth, which exists in an otherwise inhospitable solar system. The big problems that humanity faces, such as infectious diseases and the climate crisis, require our combined efforts and will impact all of us. We thus need to support each other, irrespective of such differences as gender, race or nationality. Whatever our superficial differences may be, we are much more like each other—because of knowledge—than we are to any other species.

除了批判性探究、乐观主义和责任感，其他人文主义价值观也植根于知识的存在。其中之一就是团结。有近 80 亿人生活在地球上，而地球存在于一个原本荒凉的太阳系中。人类面临的大问题，如传染病和气候危机，需要我们共同努力，并将影响我们所有人。因此，我们需要相互支持，而不考虑性别、种族或国籍等差异。无论我们的表面差异是什么，我们彼此之间的相似性 —— 因为知识 —— 比我们与其他任何物种的相似性要大得多。

Once we have established a shared commitment to the value of solidarity, we can celebrate diversity as another humanist value. In current political debates we often pit individuality against the collective as if it the two conflicted. However, to modernize John Donne, no human is an island—we are all part of societies, and of humanity at large. By recognizing the importance of our common humanity, we create the basis on which we can unfold as individuals. Solidarity allows us to celebrate, rather than fear, the diversity of the human species.

一旦我们建立了对团结价值的共同承诺，我们就可以把多样性作为另一种人文主义价值来庆祝。在当前的政治辩论中，我们经常将个人性与集体性对立起来，似乎两者之间存在冲突。然而，用约翰-多恩的话说，没有人是一座孤岛，我们都是社会的一部分，也是整个人类的一部分。通过认识到我们共同人性的重要性，我们创造了一个基础，在此基础上我们可以作为个人展开。团结使我们能够庆祝，而不是害怕人类的多样性。
