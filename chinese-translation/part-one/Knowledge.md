# 知识

Knowledge, as I use this term, is the information that humanity has recorded in a medium and improved over time. There are two crucial parts to this definition. The first is “recorded in a medium,” which allows information to be shared across time and space. The second is “improved over time,” which separates knowledge from mere information.

『知识』，正如我所使用的这个术语，是人类用一种媒介记录下来并随着时间的推移而改进的信息。这个定义有两个关键部分。第一部分是『记录在媒介中』，这使得信息可以跨越时间和空间进行共享。第二是『随着时间的推移而改进』，它将知识与单纯的信息区分开来。

A conversation that I had years ago but didn’t record cannot be knowledge in my sense—it isn’t accessible to anyone who wasn’t there when it happened, and even my own recollection of it will fade. However, if I write down an insight from that conversation and publish it on my blog, I have potentially contributed to human knowledge. The blog post is available to others across space and time, and some blog posts will turn out to be important contributions to human knowledge. As another example, the DNA in our cells isn’t knowledge by my definition, whereas a recorded genome sequence can be maintained, shared and analyzed. Gene sequences that turn out to be medically significant, such as the BRCA mutation that increases the risk of breast cancer, become part of human knowledge. 

我多年前的一次没有记录下来的谈话，在我的意义上，就不可能成为知识 —— 它不可能被任何不在现场的人获得，甚至我自己对它的回忆也会逐渐消失。然而，如果我写下那次谈话的见解，并将其发表在我的博客上，我就有可能对人类知识做出贡献。这篇博文可供其他人跨越空间和时间，而且有些博文将变成对人类知识的重要贡献。再比如，按照我的定义，我们细胞中的 DNA 并不是知识，而记录下来的基因组序列可以被维护、分享和分析。被证明具有医学意义的基因序列，如增加乳腺癌风险的 BRCA 突变，成为人类知识的一部分。

My definition of knowledge is intentionally broad, and includes not just technical and scientific knowledge but art, music and literature. But it excludes anything that is either ephemeral or not subject to improvement. Modern computers, for example, produce tons of recorded information that are not subsequently analyzed or integrated into any process of progressive bettering. The reasons for this definition of knowledge will become clear as I use the term in the following sections and throughout the book.

我对知识的定义有意放宽，不仅包括技术和科学知识，还包括艺术、音乐和文学。但它不包括任何短暂的或不能改进的东西。例如，现代计算机产生了大量的记录信息，而这些信息随后不会被分析或整合到任何逐步完善的过程中。这个知识定义的原因将在我在以下章节和全书中使用这个术语时变得清晰。
