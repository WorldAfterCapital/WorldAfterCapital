# Optimism
# 乐观主义

When I started my blog over a decade ago, I called myself a “technology optimist.“ I [wrote](http://continuations.com/post/27777558/technology-optimist):

当我在十多年前开始写博客时，我称自己是一个『技术乐观主义者』。我[写道](http://continuations.com/post/27777558/technology-optimist)。

> I am excited to be living [at] a time when we are making tremendous progress on understanding aging, fighting cancer, developing clean technologies and so much more. This is not to say that I automatically assume that technology by itself will solve all our problems […]. Instead, I believe that – over time – we as a society figure out how to use technology to […] improve our standard of living. I for one am […] glad I am not living in the Middle Ages.

> 我很高兴生活在这样一个时代，我们在理解衰老、抗击癌症、开发清洁技术和其他许多方面都取得了巨大的进展。这并不是说我自动假设技术本身会解决我们所有的问题…… 相反，我相信 —— 随着时间的推移 —— 我们这个社会会找出如何利用技术来…… 提高我们的生活水平。我很高兴我没有生活在中世纪。

This book is fundamentally optimistic, which is partly a reflection of my personality. I can’t see how it would be possible to be a venture capitalist as a pessimist. You would find yourself focusing on the reasons why a particular startup would be unlikely to succeed and as a result would never make an investment. 

这本书从根本上说是乐观的，这部分地反映了我的个性。我不知道作为一个悲观主义者，怎么可能成为一个风险投资家。你会发现自己专注于某家创业公司不可能成功的原因，因此永远不会进行投资。

I want to be clear about this apparent bias from the start. Optimism, however, is much more than a personal bias—it is essential for human knowledge. Acts of knowledge creation, such as inventing a new technology or writing a new song, are profoundly optimistic. They assume that problems can be solved, and that art will impact the audience (which is true even for a pessimistic song). Optimism is the attitude that progress is possible.

我想从一开始就清楚地说明这种明显的偏见。然而，乐观不仅仅是一种个人偏见 —— 它对人类知识来说是必不可少的。知识创造的行为，如发明一项新技术或写一首新歌，是深刻的乐观主义。他们假设问题可以被解决，艺术会影响听众（即使是悲观的歌曲也是如此）。乐观主义是一种态度，认为进步是可能的。

Progress has become a loaded term. After all, despite our technological achievements, aren’t humans also responsible for the many diseases of civilization, for the extinction of countless species, and potentially for our own demise through climate change? Without a doubt we have caused tremendous suffering throughout human history, and we are currently faced with huge problems including a global pandemic and the ongoing climate crisis. But what is the alternative to trying to tackle these?

进步已经成为一个有价值的术语。毕竟，尽管我们取得了技术上的成就，但人类不是也要为文明的许多疾病、无数物种的灭绝以及可能因气候变化而导致我们自己的灭亡负责吗？毫无疑问，我们在整个人类历史上造成了巨大的痛苦，而且我们目前面临着巨大的问题，包括全球大流行病和正在发生的气候危机。但是，除了试图解决这些问题之外，还有什么选择呢？

The beauty of problems is that knowledge can help us overcome them. Consider the problem of warming ourselves in the cold. Humans invented ways of making fire, eventually documented them, and have since dramatically improved the ways in which we can produce heat. We may take the existence of knowledge for granted, but no other species has it, which means whether they can solve a problem depends largely on luck and circumstance. So not only is optimism essential for knowledge, but the existence of knowledge is the basis for optimism. 

问题的魅力在于，知识可以帮助我们克服它们。考虑一下在寒冷中取暖的问题。人类发明了生火的方法，并最终将其记录下来，此后又极大地改进了我们产生热量的方式。我们可能认为知识的存在是理所当然的，但没有其他物种拥有这些知识，这意味着他们是否能解决一个问题主要取决于运气和环境。因此，不仅乐观主义对知识是必不可少的，而且知识的存在也是乐观主义的基础。

There is an extreme position that suggests that we would have been better off if we had never developed knowledge in the first place (Ablow, 2015). While this may sound absurd, much of religious eschatology (theology about the ‘end times’) and apocalyptic thinking is associated with this position, asserting that a grand reckoning for the sins of progress is inevitable. And while they are rare, there have even been voices welcoming the COVID-19 pandemic and the climate crisis as harbingers, if not of apocalypse, then at least of a “Great Reset.” Although there is no guarantee that all future problems will be solvable through knowledge, one thing is certain: assuming that problems cannot be solved guarantees that they will not be. Pessimism is self-defeating, and apocalyptic beliefs are self-fulfilling.

有一种极端的立场认为，如果我们一开始就不发展知识，我们会过得更好（Ablow，2015）。虽然这听起来很荒谬，但许多宗教末世论（theology about the ‘end times’）和世界末日思想都与这一立场有关，断言对进步的罪孽进行大清算是不可避免的。虽然这种说法很罕见，但甚至有声音欢迎 COVID-19 大流行病和气候危机的预兆，如果不是启示录，至少也是『大重置』的预兆。虽然不能保证所有的未来问题都可以通过知识来解决，但有一点是肯定的：假设问题不能被解决，就会保证问题不能被解决。悲观主义是自取灭亡的，而世界末日的信念是自我实现的。

All of this is also true for digital technology, which has already brought with it a new set of problems. We will encounter many of them in this book, including the huge incentives for companies such as Facebook to capture as much attention as possible, and the conflicts that arise from exposure to content that runs counter to one’s cultural or religious beliefs. And yet digital technology also enables amazing progress, such as the potential for the diagnosis of diseases at zero marginal cost. *The World After Capital* is optimistic that we can solve not only the problems of digital technology, but also that we can apply digital technology in a way that results in broad progress, including the knowledge creation needed to address the climate crisis. 

所有这些对于数字技术来说也是如此，它已经带来了一系列新的问题。我们将在本书中遇到许多这样的问题，包括对 Facebook 等公司的巨大激励，以尽可能多地捕获注意力，以及因接触到与个人文化或宗教信仰相悖的内容而产生的冲突。然而，数字技术也促成了惊人的进步，例如以零边际成本诊断疾病的潜力。《资本之后的世界》乐观地认为，我们不仅可以解决数字技术的问题，而且还可以以一种导致广泛进步的方式应用数字技术，包括解决气候危机所需的知识创造。
