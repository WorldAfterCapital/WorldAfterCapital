# Preface
# 前言

As a venture capitalist, I’m often asked: “What’s the next big thing?” People tend to ask this when they’re looking for a trend in technology, expecting me to talk to them about robotics or virtual reality. But I think that’s a boring interpretation of the question. These trends come and go as part of hype cycles that represent the waxing and waning of media interest in a particular technology. Instead I answer, “Oh, nothing much—just the end of the Industrial Age.” That momentous change is the subject of this book.

作为一名风险投资家，我经常被问到。『下一个大事件是什么？』人们往往在寻找技术趋势时问这个问题，希望我跟他们谈谈机器人技术或虚拟现实。但我认为这是对这个问题的无聊解释。 这些趋势来来去去都是炒作周期的一部分，代表了媒体对某一特定技术兴趣的消长变化。相反，我回答说：『哦，没什么--只是工业时代的结束。』这一重大变化是本书的主题。


*The World After Capital* is unabashedly about some truly big subjects. In order to tackle why the Industrial Age is ending and what is coming next, I will examine such things as the nature of technology and what it means to be human. It might seem a wildly ambitious thesis, but I argue that we are facing a transition as profound as the one which took humanity from the Agrarian Age to the Industrial Age, so nothing less will do.

《资本之后的世界》毫不掩饰地讲述了一些真正的大主题。为了解决工业时代即将结束的原因和接下来的问题，我将研究诸如技术的性质和人类的意义等问题。这似乎是一个雄心勃勃的论题，但我认为我们正面临着一个深刻的转变，就像人类从农业时代到工业时代的转变一样，所以没有什么比这更重要了。

The current transition has been made possible by the advent of digital technology, so it is essential that we understand the nature of this technology and how it differs from what preceded it. It is also essential that we examine the philosophical foundations of what we want to accomplish—after all, we have the opportunity to decide what will follow the Industrial Age. In *The World After Capital* I argue that we are now entering the Knowledge Age, and that in order to get there we must focus on the allocation of attention rather than capital. 

目前的转型由于数字技术的出现而成为可能，因此，我们必须了解这种技术的性质，以及它与之前的技术有什么不同。同样重要的是，我们要研究我们想要完成的事情的哲学基础 —— 毕竟，我们有机会决定工业时代之后的事情。在《资本之后的世界》中，我认为我们现在正在进入知识时代，为了达到这个目的，我们必须关注注意力的分配，而不是资本。

Markets fail at allocating attention because prices cannot exist for directing our attention to problems and opportunities most crucial for the survival and thriving of humanity. The climate crisis, for instance, is both more severe and more imminent than most people realize, and it is a direct result of our failure to pay attention. How quickly we address this crisis will to a great extent determine the shape of the current transition. If we do not make drastic changes quickly, getting to the next age will be even more painful than the transition to the Industrial Age, which started in the eighteenth century, involved numerous violent revolutions, and didn’t conclude until the end of the Second World War. 

市场在分配注意力方面失败了，因为不能存在价格来引导我们关注对人类的生存和繁荣最关键的问题和机会。例如，气候危机比大多数人意识到的更严重、更紧迫，它是我们未能关注的直接结果。我们如何迅速解决这一危机将在很大程度上决定当前转型的形式。如果我们不迅速做出巨大的改变，进入下一个时代将比向工业时代的过渡更加痛苦，后者始于十八世纪，涉及无数次暴力革命，直到第二次世界大战结束才结束。

The transition from the Industrial Age is already underway, and has caused massive disruption and uncertainty. Many people are fearful of change, and react by supporting populist politicians who promote the simplistic message that we should return to the past. This is happening all over the world. We saw it with the vote in the 2016 UK referendum to leave the European Union, and with the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States in the same year. I started writing *The World After Capital* before both of those events, but they underline the importance of a future-oriented narrative that shows a path forward for humanity. Going back is not a viable option, and never has been. We did not continue foraging for food after the invention of agriculture, nor did we remain farmers after the invention of industry (farming is still important, of course, but it is carried out by a tiny percentage of the population). Each of these transitions required us to find new sources of purpose. As we leave the Industrial Age behind, our purpose can no longer be derived from having a job or from an ever-growing consumption of material goods. Instead, we need to find a purpose that is compatible with the Knowledge Age. I feel incredibly fortunate to have found my purpose in advancing innovation through investing in startups, as well as in examining why this transition is happening now and suggesting how we might go about it. 

从工业时代的过渡已经在进行中，并造成了巨大的破坏和不确定性。许多人对变化感到恐惧，他们的反应是支持民粹主义政客，宣传我们应该回到过去的简单信息。这种情况正在世界各地发生。我们看到，在 2016 年英国公投中，有人投票离开欧盟，同年唐纳德·特朗普当选为美国总统。我在这两个事件之前就开始写《资本之后的世界》，但它们强调了面向未来的叙事的重要性，为人类指明了前进的道路。回归不是一个可行的选择，而且从来都不是。在农业发明之后，我们没有继续觅食，在工业发明之后，我们也没有继续当农民（当然，耕作仍然很重要，但它是由极小部分的人口进行的）。这些过渡都要求我们找到新的目的来源。当我们离开工业时代时，我们的目的不能再从拥有一份工作或从不断增长的物质产品消费中获得。相反，我们需要找到一个与知识时代相适应的目的。我感到非常幸运的是，我在通过投资初创企业来推动创新方面找到了自己的目的，同时也在研究为什么现在正在发生这种转变，并建议我们如何去做。

In a strange and wonderful way, much of what I have done in my life so far has brought me to this point. As a teenager in my native Germany in the early 1980s, I fell in love with computers. I started writing software for companies and then studied economics and computer science as an undergraduate at Harvard, writing my senior thesis on the impact of computerized trading on stock prices. After graduating I worked as a consultant and experienced the impact of information systems on the automotive, airline and electric utility industries. As a doctoral student at MIT, I wrote my dissertation on the impact of information technology on the organization of companies. As an entrepreneur, I co-founded an early Internet healthcare company. And as a venture investor, I have had the good fortune to back companies that provide transformative digital technologies and services, including Etsy, MongoDB and Twilio. 

迄今为止我在生活中所做的大部分事情都把我带到了这一点上，这真是一种奇怪而奇妙的方式。20 世纪 80 年代初，在我的家乡德国，我还是个少年，就爱上了计算机。我开始为公司编写软件，然后在哈佛大学读本科时学习经济学和计算机科学，写了一篇关于计算机化交易对股票价格影响的毕业论文。毕业后，我担任了顾问，体验了信息系统对汽车、航空和电力行业的影响。作为麻省理工学院的博士生，我的论文写的是信息技术对公司组织的影响。作为一名企业家，我与他人共同创办了一家早期的互联网保健公司。而作为一个风险投资者，我有幸支持了那些提供变革性数字技术和服务的公司，包括 Etsy、MongoDB 和 Twilio。

You might be wondering why I would choose to write this book as a VC—after all, surely it’s a distraction from finding and managing investments in startups? However, working with startups gives me a window into the future: I get to see trends and developments before they become widely understood, and this puts me in a good position to write about what is going to happen. At the same time, writing about the future that I would like to see will help me find companies that can help bring that future about. I am writing *The World After Capital* because what I see compels me to do so, but I am also confident that writing it has made me a better investor. 

你可能会想，为什么我会选择以风险投资人的身份来写这本书 —— 毕竟，这肯定会分散我对寻找和管理初创企业投资的注意力？然而，与初创企业一起工作给了我一个了解未来的窗口。我可以在趋势和发展被广泛了解之前看到它们，这使我处于一个很好的位置来写即将发生的事情。同时，撰写我希望看到的未来，将有助于我找到能够帮助实现这一未来的公司。我写《资本之后的世界》是因为我看到的东西迫使我这样做，但我也相信，写这本书使我成为一个更好的投资者。
