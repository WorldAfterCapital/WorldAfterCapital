# Part Two: Capital Is Sufficient
# 第二部分：资本是充足的

In saying that capital is ‘sufficient’, I mean that there is enough of it to meet our needs. That’s what I set out to show in this part of the book. The only way to do so is by examining what those needs are, and separating them clearly from our unlimited wants. We must then consider population trends, so we can see how many humans are likely to have those needs in the future. Only then can we attempt to see if our existing capital is sufficient to meet them.

我说资本是『充足的』，是指有足够的资本来满足我们的需要。这就是我在本书的这一部分所要说明的。做到这一点的唯一方法是检查这些需求是什么，并将它们与我们无限的需求明确分开。然后我们必须考虑人口趋势，这样我们就可以看到未来有多少人可能会有这些需求。只有这样，我们才能尝试看看我们现有的资本是否足以满足它们。
