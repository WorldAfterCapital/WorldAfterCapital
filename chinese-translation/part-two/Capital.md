# Capital
# 资本

As implied by the title of this book, one of my fundamental claims is that there is enough capital in the world to meet everyone’s needs. That means meeting the individual needs of at least 7.9 billion people, as well as the collective needs of the societies they live in. If there is plenty of slack today, capital will no longer be the binding constraint for humanity going forward, as population growth is decelerating while technological progress is accelerating.

正如本书的标题所暗示的，我的一个基本主张是，世界上有足够的资本来满足每个人的需求。这意味着满足至少 79 亿人的个人需求，以及他们所处社会的集体需求。如果今天有大量的闲置资金，那么资本将不再是人类未来的约束性制约因素，因为人口增长正在减速，而技术进步正在加速。

It is tempting to look at this in terms of financial capital, but that would be giving in to the illusion of money. Dollar bills don’t feed people and gold bars can’t be used as smartphones. The capital that fundamentally matters is productive physical capital, such as machines and buildings.

从金融资本的角度来看待这个问题是很诱人的，但这将是屈服于金钱的幻觉。纸币不能养活人，金条不能作为智能手机使用。从根本上说，重要的资本是生产性实物资本，如机器和建筑物。

Financial capital is not irrelevant, of course – it is required for the initial construction of physical capital and to meet the ongoing needs of economic activity. If I want to build a factory or a store, I need to pay the construction workers and the suppliers of machines before I can start making money. And many businesses have ongoing expenses to pay each month before they can collect revenues from customers. When cash outflows precede cash inflows, a financing mechanism is required. To accumulate physical capital, we need to be able to accumulate financial capital.

当然，金融资本并非无关紧要 —— 它是物质资本的初始建设和满足经济活动的持续需求所需要的。如果我想建一个工厂或商店，在我开始赚钱之前，我需要支付建筑工人和机器供应商。而许多企业在向客户收取收入之前，每个月都有持续的支出需要支付。当现金流出先于现金流入时，就需要一个融资机制。为了积累物质资本，我们需要能够积累金融资本。

In the history of financial capital there have been many important innovations, and the introduction of marketplace lending has been an important recent one. The allocation of financial capital to projects through markets has been enormously successful, and it is the success of the market-based approach that has given us a large enough physical capital base to meet our basic needs. I should be quick to point out, as I have done elsewhere in the book, that the market-based approach relies on plenty of governmental activity, such as pro-competition regulation and the funding of education and research.

在金融资本的历史上，有许多重要的创新，而市场贷款的引入是最近的一个重要创新。通过市场将金融资本分配给项目的做法取得了巨大的成功，正是基于市场的方法的成功，使我们有足够大的物质资本基础来满足我们的基本需求。我应该迅速指出，正如我在书中其他地方所做的那样，基于市场的方法依赖于大量的政府活动，如有利于竞争的监管和教育及研究的资助。

Many recent innovations in finance, however, rather than contributing to the creation and allocation of physical capital, have had the opposite effect, instead leading to the excessive ‘financialization’ of the economy. This refers to growth in financial activities that help generate personal wealth for some but that are decoupled from, or even harm, the formation of physical capital. One example of excess financialization is companies borrowing money to buy back shares instead of investing in innovation. The derivatives and structured securities, such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), that powered the housing bubble are another example. This is not to say that there are no potentially legitimate uses of these tools – it is just that they have grown far beyond what is needed for physical capital formation and taken on a life of their own. This can be seen both in the increased size of the financial sector as a proportion of the overall economy and in the wealth generated by making money from money instead of from productive capital (Lahart, 2011; Lewis, 2018).

然而，最近的许多金融创新非但没有促进物质资本的创造和分配，反而产生了相反的效果，反而导致了经济的过度『金融化』。这指的是金融活动的增长，它有助于为一些人创造个人财富，但与物质资本的形成脱钩，甚至损害物质资本的形成。过度金融化的一个例子是公司借钱买回股票，而不是投资于创新。为房地产泡沫提供动力的衍生品和结构性证券，如抵押债务凭证（CDO），是另一个例子。这并不是说这些工具没有潜在的合法用途 —— 只是它们的发展已经远远超出了实际资本形成的需要，并且有了自己的生命。这可以从金融部门在整体经济中的比例增加，以及从货币而不是生产性资本中赚钱所产生的财富中看出来（Lahart，2011；Lewis，2018）。

What is the role of ’human capital’ in all of this? I find this relatively new term to be a fundamental misnomer. Humans provide labor, and machines are capital. We saw earlier that, as Malthus had predicted, there was an exponential population explosion. As a result labor has not been a constraint on meeting our needs. That does not mean that we have not had labor shortages from time-to-time, but these have largely been the result of policy choices, such as restrictions on immigration or discriminatory access to education, rather than reflecting fundamentally scarce labor.

在这一切中，『人力资本』的作用是什么？我发现这个相对较新的术语是一个基本的误称。人类提供劳动力，而机器是资本。我们早些时候看到，正如马尔萨斯所预测的那样，出现了指数级的人口爆炸。因此，劳动力并没有成为满足我们需求的制约因素。这并不意味着我们没有时不时地出现劳动力短缺，但这主要是政策选择的结果，如对移民的限制或歧视性的教育机会，而不是反映出劳动力的根本稀缺。

The better question to ask is: what is the role of *knowledge*? The answer is that advances in knowledge are essential for making capital more effective. Even more fundamentally, physical capital cannot exist in the first place without knowledge. Take a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner, for example: you can’t build one without a great deal of knowledge of physics and engineering. However, in a world where everyone’s needs are taken care of, it might be possible to build the same machine without the need for financial capital, as you might not have to pay people in advance. And with enough knowledge, in the form of advanced robots, it will even be possible to build one without any ’human capital’ – labor – at all.

要问的更好的问题是：『知识』的作用是什么？答案是，知识的进步对于使资本更加有效至关重要。更为根本的是，没有知识，物质资本就无法存在。以磁共振成像（MRI）扫描仪为例：如果没有大量的物理学和工程学知识，你就无法建造一台。然而，在一个每个人的需求都得到照顾的世界里，也许有可能在不需要金融资本的情况下建造同样的机器，因为你可能不需要提前付钱给人。如果有足够的知识，以先进的机器人的形式，甚至有可能在没有任何『人力资本』—— 劳动力 —— 的情况下建造一个。


In conclusion here, we should realize that the accumulation of financial capital does not contribute to meeting our needs in and of itself. Imagine a Spanish galleon full of gold caught in a storm. Although the sailors aboard had ample access to financial capital, what they really needed to survive was either more knowledge or better physical capital. For example, if they had more knowledge of the weather, they could have circumnavigated the storm. Or if they had a stronger boat, they could have simply ridden it out. If anything, the gold is a hindrance to their survival – throwing it overboard might help the boat get away from the storm more quickly.

在此总结，我们应该认识到，金融资本的积累本身无助于满足我们的需求。想象一下，一艘满载黄金的西班牙大帆船遇到了风暴。虽然船上的水手们有充足的机会获得金融资本，但他们真正需要的是更多的知识或更好的物质资本来生存。例如，如果他们对天气有更多的了解，他们就能绕过风暴。或者，如果他们有一艘更强大的船，他们可以简单地渡过难关。如果有的话，黄金对他们的生存是一种阻碍 —— 把它扔到海里可能会帮助船更快地离开风暴。

We will now examine whether physical capital is sufficient to meet our needs.

我们现在将研究物质资本是否足以满足我们的需要。

## Individual Needs
## 个人需求

My claim is that capital is no longer the binding constraint on our ability to meet our individual needs. This is especially true for the developed economies, but it is increasingly true globally. Let’s start by considering the needs emanating from keeping our bodies powered (see the Appendix for additional supporting information).

我的主张是，资本不再是对我们满足个人需求能力的约束性限制。这对发达经济体来说尤其如此，但在全球范围内也越来越如此。让我们首先考虑保持我们的身体动力所产生的需求（见附录中的额外支持信息）。

**Oxygen**: There’s plenty of air for us to breathe; the key challenge is to make sure it is clean and safely breathable. China and India are both currently struggling with this, but they developed rapidly and are reliant on outdated energy sources. What is needed here are improvements to capital, such as switching to electric cars from internal combustion engine ones.

**氧气**。有大量的空气供我们呼吸；关键的挑战是要确保空气的清洁和安全呼吸。中国和印度目前都在努力解决这个问题，但他们发展迅速，而且依赖过时的能源。这里需要的是对资本的改进，例如从内燃机汽车转为电动汽车。

**Water**: There’s plenty of water for everyone in the world to drink (the oceans are full of it). Though there are distribution and access problems, including in the United States (for example, the crisis of polluted drinking water in Flint, Michigan), physical capital is not a binding constraint. We are even able to build new desalination plants in record time.

**水**：世界上有足够的水供每个人饮用（海洋里充满了水）。虽然存在分配和获取问题，包括在美国（例如密歇根州弗林特市的饮用水污染危机），但物质资本并不是一个有约束力的制约因素。我们甚至能够在创纪录的时间内建造新的海水淡化厂。

**Calories**: We have made dramatic progress in farming: as a result of increased productivity, the rate of increase in the amount of land used globally to produce has plummeted, and the amount of land used worldwide for agriculture may have already peaked (Ramankutty et al., 2018; Ausubel et al., 2013). There have been significant recent breakthroughs in vertical farming, the practice of growing plants under controlled conditions, and in automated farming. For instance, one of the world’s largest vertical farms operates in Jersey City, and the Japanese indoor farming company Spread’s automated facility will can produce 30,000 heads of lettuce per day (Harding, 2020).

**卡路里**。我们在农业方面取得了巨大的进步：由于生产力的提高，全球用于生产的土地数量的增长速度急剧下降，全球用于农业的土地数量可能已经达到了顶峰（Ramankutty et al.，2018；Ausubel et al.，2013）。最近在垂直耕作（在受控条件下种植植物的做法）和自动耕作方面取得了重大突破。例如，世界上最大的垂直农场之一在泽西市运营，日本室内农业公司 Spread 的自动化设施将可以每天生产 30,000 头生菜（Harding，2020）。

**Nutrients**: This is primarily a question of knowledge, as we still don’t fully understand which nutrients the body really needs to ingest in what quantities. We obtain most of them from food, but depending on our diet we may need to add some supplements. The remaining amounts tend to be small, and we can produce plenty of them already (in developed countries, entire industries have sprung up trying to convince people to buy and consume food supplements that they do not need).

**营养物质**：这主要是一个知识问题，因为我们仍然不完全了解身体真正需要摄入哪些营养物质的数量。我们从食物中获得大部分营养，但根据我们的饮食，我们可能需要添加一些补充剂。剩余的数量往往很少，而且我们已经可以生产大量的营养物质（在发达国家，整个行业已经兴起，试图说服人们购买和消费他们不需要的食物补充剂）。

**Discharge**: This is primarily addressed through modern sewage technology. Here too, capital is no longer a binding constraint, though its uneven distribution around the world is a problem.

**排放**：这主要是通过现代污水处理技术来解决。在这里，资本也不再是一个有约束力的制约因素，尽管它在世界各地的分布不均衡是一个问题。

Now let’s consider the needs relating to the operating environment for humans.

现在让我们来考虑与人类操作环境有关的需求。

**Temperature**: The Chinese construction boom of the early 2000s illustrates how quickly we can build shelter, which, together with heating and air conditioning, is one crucial solution to our temperature needs. In the US, in the opening years of the 21st century, a construction boom was powered by artificially cheap mortgage credit. Though a lot of housing was built speculatively and remained empty, it powerfully demonstrated our construction capacity. Clothing is another strategy for meeting our temperature needs. The price of clothing has been falling in many parts of the world, including the United States. Capital is not a constraint here – indeed, we have the ability to clothe the world’s population many times over.

**温度**：中国二十一世纪初的建筑热潮说明了我们可以多么迅速地建造住房，它与供暖和空调一起，是解决我们温度需求的一个重要办法。在美国，在二十一世纪的最初几年，建筑热潮是由人为的廉价抵押贷款推动的。虽然很多住房是投机性建造的，仍然是空的，但它有力地证明了我们的建筑能力。服装是满足我们温度需求的另一个策略。在世界许多地方，包括美国，衣服的价格一直在下降。资本在这里不是一个制约因素 —— 事实上，我们有能力为世界上的人口提供多倍的衣服。

**Pressure**: Thankfully, we have nothing to do here, as we have plenty of space for humans to live in the right pressure range. This is a great example of a need that we do not consider much at all, but that would loom very large if land were to cease to be habitable and we had to go underwater or into space.

**压力**：值得庆幸的是，我们在这里没有什么可做的，因为我们有足够的空间让人类在合适的压力范围内生活。这是一个很好的例子，说明我们根本没有过多地考虑这种需求，但如果陆地不再适合居住，我们不得不进入水下或太空，这种需求会非常大。

**Light**: We have become very good at providing light. One study shows how the hours of light provided by 60 hours of labor in the United States exploded from around 10 in 1800 to over 100,000 by 1990 (Harford, 2017; Nordhaus, 1994). Since then, we have made considerable further progress with LED lighting. That progress has also come to other parts of the world, for instance in the form of off-grid, solar-powered lamps.

**光**：我们在提供光线方面已经变得非常出色。一项研究表明，在美国，60 小时的劳动所提供的光照时间是如何从 1800 年的 10 小时左右爆发到 1990 年的 10 万多小时的（Harford, 2017; Nordhaus, 1994）。从那时起，我们已经在 LED 照明方面取得了相当大的进一步进展。这种进步也来到了世界其他地区，例如以离网、太阳能供电的灯具的形式。

Finally we come to the more abstract individual needs.

最后，我们来谈谈更抽象的个人需求。

**Healing**: We often read that healthcare consumes an increasingly large fraction of the economy, especially in the United States, but that does not imply that capital is scarce. In industrialized countries we have plenty of hospital space and doctor’s offices. But, you may ask, didn’t the COVID-19 pandemic show that we didn’t have enough ICU beds? The answer is no: countries that reacted to the virus in good time stayed well within their capacity. Overall capital is sufficient for healing. We have extensive diagnostic facilities and are able to produce large quantities of medicine.

**疗养**：我们经常读到，医疗保健在经济中的消耗越来越大，特别是在美国，但这并不意味着资本的稀缺。在工业化国家，我们有大量的医院空间和医生的办公室。但是，你可能会问 ，COVID-19 的大流行不是表明我们没有足够的 ICU 床位吗？答案是否定的：及时对病毒作出反应的国家都在其能力范围内保持良好的状态。总的来说，资本是足够用来治疗的。我们有广泛的诊断设施，能够生产大量的药品。

**Learning**: Nor are we constrained by capital when it comes to learning. This is increasingly true not just in industrialized nations but also globally, due to the expansion of wireless networks and the increasing affordability of smartphones. We are not far away from reaching a point where we have enough capital for anyone in the world to learn anything that can be transmitted over the Internet; the binding constraint is the availability of affordable content and the time it takes to learn and teach.

**学习**：在学习方面，我们也没有受到资本的限制。不仅在工业化国家，而且在全球范围内，由于无线网络的扩展和智能手机的日益廉价，这一点也越来越真实。我们离达到这样的程度并不遥远，即我们有足够的资本让世界上的任何人学习任何可以通过互联网传输的东西；具有约束力的制约因素是能否获得负担得起的内容以及学习和教学所需的时间。

**Meaning**: The final individual need, that of meaning, is not and has never been constrained by capital. Capital plays no role in meeting our need for it.

**意义**：个人的最终需求，即意义的需求，没有也从来没有受到资本的限制。资本在满足我们对它的需求方面没有发挥任何作用。

## Collective Needs
## 集体需求

At first it might seem difficult to see how capital relates to our collective needs. How could it have anything to do with such abstract concepts as motivation and coordination? In discussing why capital is already sufficient today to meet our collective needs, I will also briefly point out how it was scarce with regard to these needs in the past.

起初，我们似乎很难看到资本与我们的集体需求有什么关系。它怎么可能与动机和协调这样的抽象概念有任何关系？在讨论为什么今天的资本已经足以满足我们的集体需求时，我还将简要地指出，在过去，资本在这些需求方面是如何匮乏的。

**Reproduction**: Available capital has always been sufficient for reproduction – otherwise, we wouldn’t be here today.

**繁殖**：可用的资本一直都足以进行繁殖 —— 否则，我们就不会有今天了。

**Allocation**: During the Industrial Age the allocation of capital, such as where to build a factory and what it should produce, was the central allocation problem, and it was the scarcity of capital that made it difficult to meet this need. When there were few roads and other means of transportation, there were few places a factory could be built. Getting the place just right and building the right factory was thus a much harder problem than today where we can ship products around the world. As a result, the allocation problem for capital is no longer constrained by capital. And because capital is no longer scarce, it is also no longer the dominant allocation problem. As we will see in the next section, it has been replaced by the allocation of attention, for which capital is largely irrelevant.

**分配**：在工业时代，资本的分配，如在哪里建厂，应该生产什么，是核心的分配问题，正是资本的稀缺性使得这一需求难以满足。当道路和其他运输工具很少的时候，可以建厂的地方也很少。因此，与今天我们可以将产品运往世界各地的情况相比，找到合适的地方并建造合适的工厂是一个难得多的问题。因此，资本的分配问题不再受制于资本。而且，由于资本不再稀缺，它也不再是主导的分配问题。正如我们将在下一节看到的，它已被注意力的分配所取代，而资本在很大程度上与此无关。

**Motivation**: Again, it might at first seem as if capital never played a role here. But consider what it was like to work in an early factory, when the outputs were generally not affordable for the workers. Workers at the time had to more or less be forced into factory work, a situation that still persists in some parts of the world for certain industries (e.g., clothing and hardware assembly). Contrast this with much of the period following the Second World War, when more advanced economies already had a fair bit of capital, making possible the mass production of goods that workers could afford. Motivation can of course come from many sources other than what wages can buy, such as wanting to help others (e.g. in healthcare) or facing an enemy (e.g. wartime production). The key point is that today motivation is no longer constrained by capital in principle.

**动机**：同样，起初看起来似乎资本从未在这里发挥过作用。但想想在早期的工厂工作是什么样子的，当时的产出一般都是工人负担不起的。当时的工人不得不或多或少地被迫在工厂工作，这种情况在世界某些地区的某些行业（如服装和硬件组装）仍然存在。与此相比，二战后的大部分时间里，更先进的经济体已经拥有相当多的资本，使得大规模生产工人能够负担得起的商品成为可能。当然，动机可以来自工资所能购买的东西以外的许多来源，例如想要帮助他人（例如在医疗保健方面）或面对敌人（例如战时生产）。关键的一点是，今天的动机在原则上不再受到资本的限制。

**Coordination**: One of the primary ways to meet the need for coordination is through communication, which was heavily constrained by capital for the longest time. Today, however, we can hold a real-time video conference with nearly anybody in the world. And some of the big coverage gaps, such as parts of Africa, are rapidly being filled in.

**协调**：满足协调需求的主要方式之一是通过通信，在很长一段时间里，通信受到资本的严重制约。然而今天，我们几乎可以与世界上的任何人举行实时视频会议。而一些大的覆盖空白，如非洲的部分地区，正在迅速被填补。

**Knowledge**: Finally, our collective need for knowledge was long constrained by capital. Making books, for instance, was expensive and time-consuming, and copies could only be made by humans, which introduced errors. The spread of knowledge was limited by the need to create and supply physical copies, constraints that we have now left behind. There were also other ways in which capital was scarce as far as knowledge was concerned. For instance, we had insufficient scientific instruments for inspecting matter, such as microscopes. Today, by contrast, we are able to build massive undertakings to support science, such as the Large Hadron Collider.

**知识**：最后，我们对知识的集体需求长期受制于资本。例如，制作书籍既昂贵又费时，而且只能由人制作副本，这就会产生错误。知识的传播受制于创造和提供实体副本的需要，这些限制现在已经被我们抛在脑后。就知识而言，还有其他资本匮乏的方式。例如，我们没有足够的科学仪器来检查物质，如显微镜。相比之下，今天我们能够建立大规模的事业来支持科学，如大型强子对撞机。

## Enablers
## 赋能者

Our progress on the four foundational enablers – energy, resources, transformation and transportation – is another way to understand why capital is no longer scarce. There have been massive breakthroughs on all four during the Industrial Age.

我们在能源、资源、转型和运输这四个基本要素上的进展，是理解为什么资本不再稀缺的另一种方式。在工业时代，这四个方面都取得了巨大的突破。

**Energy**: The biggest breakthrough in energy was the development of electricity, which allowed us to apply energy precisely. Our remaining challenges relate to the production, storage and distribution of electricity. Further improvements will let us meet different needs in new ways, but we are not fundamentally energy-constrained. For instance, at current efficiency rates, covering less than 0.1% of the Earth’s surface with solar panels could meet all of today’s energy needs (Berners-Lee, 2019).

**能源**：能源方面最大的突破是电力的发展，它使我们能够精确地应用能源。我们剩下的挑战与电力的生产、储存和分配有关。进一步的改进将使我们以新的方式满足不同的需求，但我们并没有从根本上受到能源限制。例如，按照目前的效率，用太阳能电池板覆盖不到 0.1% 的地球表面就可以满足今天所有的能源需求（Berners-Lee，2019）。

**Resources**: The availability of resources was completely transformed during the Industrial Age through mining, which was enabled by innovation in transportation (railways) and energy (steam power). People who have concerns about sustainability sometimes point to the scarcity of resources as the primary constraint, but there are three sources that we can tap in the future: recycling, asteroid mining, and eventually transmutation (turning one element into another, as in the alchemists’ quest to turn lead into gold). For instance, a lot of electronics currently end up in landfill instead of being recycled, we achieved the first soft landing on an asteroid as far back as 2001, and we can already turn lithium into tritium.

**资源**：在工业时代，通过采矿，资源的可用性被完全改变了，这是由运输（铁路）和能源（蒸汽动力）的创新促成的。对可持续发展有顾虑的人有时会指出资源的稀缺性是主要的制约因素，但我们在未来可以利用三种资源：回收、小行星采矿和最终的转化（将一种元素转化为另一种元素，如炼金术士将铅转化为金的追求）。例如，目前很多电子产品最终被填埋，而不是被回收，我们早在 2001 年就实现了在小行星上的首次软着陆，而且我们已经可以将锂变成氚。

**Transformation**: Our ability to transform materials also improved radically during the Industrial Age. For instance, chemistry enabled the synthetic production of rubber, which previously had to be harvested from trees. Machine tools enabled the rapid transformation of wood and metals. We later added transformation technologies such as injection molding and additive manufacturing technologies (often referred to as “3D printing”).

**转化**：在工业时代，我们改造材料的能力也得到了彻底的提高。例如，化学使橡胶的合成生产成为可能，而以前橡胶必须从树上采摘。机器工具使木材和金属得以快速转化。后来，我们又增加了一些改造技术，如注射成型和增材制造技术（通常称为『3D 打印』）。

**Transportation**: Here we went from human-, animal- and wind-powered movement to machine-powered movement, dramatically increasing our capabilities. We can now fly across continents and oceans on commercial flights, reaching any major city in a single day, and there has been extraordinary progress in flight safety. While some have complained about a recent lack of progress, pointing to the lack of commercial supersonic options following the retirement of Concorde, work has recently resumed on developing new options for commercial supersonic flight. We have also made tremendous progress on reusable rockets and autonomous vehicles (for instance, drones and robots used in warehouses).

**交通**：在这里，我们从人类、动物和风力驱动的运动变成了机器驱动的运动，极大地提高了我们的能力。我们现在可以通过商业航班飞越各大洲和大洋，在一天之内到达任何主要城市，而且在飞行安全方面有了非凡的进步。虽然有些人抱怨最近缺乏进展，指出协和飞机退役后缺乏商业超音速的选择，但最近已经恢复了开发商业超音速飞行新选择的工作。我们在可重复使用的火箭和自主车辆（例如，无人机和仓库中使用的机器人）方面也取得了巨大的进展。

The progress made on all these enablers has allowed us to produce more physical capital, to do so more rapidly and cheaply, and to transport it anywhere in the world. One illustration of how far we have come is the fact that smartphones only became available in 2000, but by 2017 there were over 2 billion smartphone users in the world.

在所有这些推动因素上取得的进展，使我们能够生产更多的实物资本，更迅速、更廉价地生产，并将其运送到世界任何地方。一个说明我们已经取得了多大成就的事实是，智能手机在 2000 年才开始使用，但到 2017 年，世界上有超过 20 亿智能手机用户。

I am not claiming that everyone’s needs are being met today, nor am I arguing that governments should be meeting people’s needs through government-run programs such as food stamps or subsidized housing – quite the opposite. My point is simply that physical capital is no longer the constraint when it comes to meeting our individual and collective needs.

我并不是说今天每个人的需求都得到了满足，也不是说政府应该通过政府管理的项目，如食品券或补贴住房来满足人们的需求 —— 恰恰相反。我的观点是，当涉及到满足我们的个人和集体需求时，物质资本不再是制约因素。

The great success of capitalism is that capital is no longer scarce. However, we now face a scarcity of attention, and, as we will see, capitalism cannot and will not properly address that new scarcity without dramatic changes in how we regulate our society and ourselves.

资本主义的巨大成功在于，资本不再稀缺。然而，我们现在面临着注意力的稀缺，而且，正如我们将看到的，如果不对我们的社会和我们自己的监管方式进行巨大的改变，资本主义不能也不会适当地解决这种新的稀缺性。
